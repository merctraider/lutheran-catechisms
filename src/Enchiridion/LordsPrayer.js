            <CatechismSection additionalHeading="PREFACE." mainHeading="Our Father who art in heaven." >
                <i>What does this imply?</i>
                <p><i>Ans.— </i>That God thereby intends to incite us to believe that he is truly our father, and that we are truly his children; so that we may cheerfully and with all confidence entreat him as loving children do their beloved father.</p>
            </CatechismSection>

            <CatechismSection additionalHeading="THE FIRST PETITION." mainHeading="Hallowed be thy name." >
                <i>What does this imply?</i>
                <p><i>Ans.— </i>That although God’s name is holy in itself, nevertheless we pray in this petition that it may be sanctified by us also.</p>
                <i>How does this come to pass?</i>
                <p><i>Ans.— </i> When the Word of God is purely and correctly taught, and we as the children of God according thereto lead holy lives. In doing this may our heavenly Father assist us! But whosoever teaches and lives otherwise than the Word of God teaches, profanes the name of God among us. Against which, mayest thou our heavenly Father, defend us!</p>

            <CatechismSection additionalHeading="THE SECOND PETITION." mainHeading="Thy kingdom come." >
                <i>What does this imply?</i>
                <p><i>Ans.— </i>That although the kingdom of God indeed comes without our prayer, nevertheless we pray in this petition that it may also come to us.</p>
                <i>How does this come to pass?</i>
                <p><i>Ans.— </i>When our heavenly Father grants us his Holy Spirit, so that we through his grace believe his blessed Word, and live a godly life in time and eternity.</p>
            </CatechismSection>

            <CatechismSection additionalHeading="THE THIRD PETITION." mainHeading="Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven." >
                <i>What does this imply?</i>
                <p><i>Ans.— </i>That although the good and gracious will of God indeed is done without our prayer, nevertheless we pray in this petition that it may also be done by us.</p>
                <i>How does this come to pass?</i>
                <p><i>Ans.— </i> When God frustrates all wicked counsels and designs, which prevent the sanctification of his name and the coming of his kingdom,—such as those of the devil, of the world, and of our own flesh; and when he strengthens and preserves us firmly in his Word, and in the faith unto the end. This is his good and gracious will.</p>
            </CatechismSection>

            <CatechismSection additionalHeading="THE FOURTH PETITION." mainHeading="Give us this day our daily bread." >
                <i>What does this imply?</i>
                <p><i>Ans.— </i>That God indeed gives daily bread without our prayer, even unto all the wicked; but we pray in this petition that he would make us sensible of his goodness, so that we may receive our daily bread with thanksgiving.</p>
                <i>What is meant by daily bread?</i>
                <p><i>Ans.— </i>Whatever pertains to the support and the necessities of this life; such as meat and drink, raiment and shoes, house, residence, and lands; cattle, money, and goods; a pious spouse, pious children and servants; pious and faithful rulers, a good government; good seasons, peace and health; discipline and honor; good friends, faithful neighbors, and the like blessings.</p>
            </CatechismSection>

            <CatechismSection additionalHeading="THE FIFTH PETITION" mainHeading="And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us." >
                <i>What does this imply?</i>
                <p><i>Ans.— </i>That we pray in this petition that our heavenly Father would not remember our sins, nor for the sake of the same deny our petitions, (as we are not worthy nor deserving of the things for which we pray,) but that he would give us those things through mercy; for we sin much daily, and deserve nothing but punishment. We also promise again heartily to forgive those, and freely to do them good, who sin against us.</p>
            </CatechismSection>

            <CatechismSection additionalHeading="THE SIXTH PETITION." mainHeading="And lead us not into temptation." >
                <i>What does this imply?</i>
                <p><i>Ans.— </i>That although God tempts no one to sin, yet we pray in this petition that he would preserve us; so that the devil, the world, and our own flesh, may not beguile nor seduce us into unbelief and despair, or into other great and ignominious vices; and though we should thus be tempted, that we may notwithstanding finally obtain the victory.</p>
            </CatechismSection>

            <CatechismSection additionalHeading="THE SEVENTH PETITION." mainHeading="But deliver us from evil." >
                <i>What does this imply?</i>
                <p><i>Ans.— </i>That we pray in this petition as in a summary, that our heavenly Father would deliver us from all manner of evil, injurious to the body and soul, property and character; and finally at the arrival of the hour of death grant us a happy departure, and graciously receive us from this troublesome world to himself, to the mansions of glory.</p>
            </CatechismSection>

            <CatechismSection additionalHeading="THE CONCLUSION." mainHeading="Amen." >
                <i>What does Amen signify?</i>
                <p><i>Ans.— </i>That I shall be assured that such petitions are acceptable to our heavenly Father, and heard of him; for he himself has commanded us thus to pray, and has promised that he will hear us. Amen, amen, signifies yea, yea, it shall be so.</p>
