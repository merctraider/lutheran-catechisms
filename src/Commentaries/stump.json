                "content":"<p><strong>The Ten Commandments</strong> are called the <i>Moral Law</i>, or more briefly the Law, and sometimes the Decalogue or the Ten Words. They make known to us God's will, which is the law for all His creatures. Each commandment has a <i>negative</i> side, and <i>forbids</i> something; each has also a <i>positive</i> side, and <i>commands</i> or enjoins something.</p> <p><strong>The Giving Of The Law.</strong> The Law of God was originally written in man's heart at creation. [Rom. 2:15] We call that law in the heart, Conscience. After the fall into sin, the conscience became darkened, and men did not always know right from wrong, and fell into gross idolatry. [Rom. 1:21-23] God, therefore, through Moses at Mount Sinai, gave men His law anew, [Exod. 20:1] written on two Tables of stone. [Exod. 31:18] He also gave the Israelites national and ceremonial laws. These, being meant for a particular people and a certain era of the world, are no longer binding upon us. But the Moral Law has been expressly confirmed by our Lord Jesus Christ as valid for all time and binding upon all men. [Matt. 22:37-40+]</p> <p><strong>The substance of the law</strong> is, “Thou shalt love the Lord Thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind.” and “Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.”</p> <p><strong>The purpose of the law</strong> is, 1. To put a check upon wicked men, [I Tim. 1:9] 2. To convince us of our sinfulness [Rom. 3:20+] and our need of the Saviour, [Gal. 3:24+] and 3. To be our rule and guide for Christian conduct. [John. 14:15+, Matt. 7:12+] It is especially with respect to the second purpose here mentioned, that the Ten Commandments were assigned by Luther to the first and not to a later place in his catechism.</p> <p><strong>The Two Tables.</strong> The Ten Commandments may be divided into two parts, called the Two Tables of the Law. [Exod. 31:18] The First Table includes the first three commandments, and teaches us our Duty to God. The Second Table Includes the last seven commandments, and teaches us our Duty to our Fellow-men.</p> <p>The Ten Commandments are not numbered in the Bible. A two-fold numbering is found among Christians. The first is that which is given in our Catechism, and which is accepted by the majority of Christians, The other numbering makes two commandments of our first (the second being the command not to make any images), and joins our ninth and tenth into one. This makes a difference in the numbering of all the commandments except the first.</p> <p><strong>Questions.—</strong> 1. What other names are given to the Tea Commandments? 2. What do they make known to us? 3. What two sides are there to each commandment? 4. Where was the law of God originally written? 5. Why and when was the Law given anew? 6. Why is the Moral Law binding upon us, while the national and ceremonial laws of Israel are not? 7. What is the substance of the Law? 8. What is the threefold purpose of the Law? 9. Into how many Tables is the Law divided, and what does each Table teach? 10. How many commandments does each Table include?</p> <p><strong>SCRIPTURE VERSES.—</strong>Matt. 22:37-40. Jesus said unto him, Thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.</p> <p>Rom. 3:20. Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.</p> <p>Gal. 3:24. Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.</p> <p>John 14:15. If ye love me, keep my commandments.</p> <p>Matt. 7:12. Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.</p> <p><strong>Reading.—</strong>The Giving of the Law at Mt. Sinai, Exod. 19 and 20.</p>"

                "content":"<p>I am the Lord thy God.</p> <p><strong>These introductory words</strong> show who is the Lawgiver. [Jas. 4:12] As earthly kings place their names at the beginning of their decrees to give them authority, so God places His name at the beginning of the commandments in order to make known who gives them, and whose displeasure we shall incur if we disobey them. These introductory words belong not only to the first but to all the commandments.</p> <p><strong>I AM.</strong> By these words God reminds us that He is a Person. He speaks to us. He is not an impersonal God who pervades and is a part of nature. He is above nature and has created it. [Gen 1:1]</p> <p><strong>THE LORD.</strong> The word here translated “Lord” means in the original Hebrew “I AM THAT I AM.” [Exod 8:14+] God thereby declares that He is the One and Only Self-existent, [Isa 44:6+] Eternal, [Ps 90:1, 2+] and Unchangeable Being. [Mal 3:6+] He is the true and living God in contradistinction from all so-called gods. [Jer 10:10] The name Jehovah or “LORD” is used in the Old Testament Scriptures to designate God as the covenant God of Israel. It signified that He stood in a specially near relation to them as His chosen people. The name has the same comforting meaning for Christians; for they are the New Testament people of God. [Tit 2:14+, I Pet 2-9]</p> <p><strong>THY GOD.</strong> These words express God’s good-will toward us. He is our God who loves [Jer 31:3+] us and cares for us. [I Pet 5:7] He said to Israel, “I am the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.” He has delivered us from the still greater bondage of sin, death, and the devil through His Son Jesus Christ, [Col 1:13+] and has a right to expect our gratitude and love.</p> <p><strong>THE LORD THY GOD.</strong> He who gives us these commandments is a Spirit [John 4:24+] of infinite majesty and goodness. He is:</p> <ol> <li><i>Eternal</i>; He always was and always will be. [Ps 90:2]</li> <li><i>Unchangeable</i>; He always was and always will be the same. [Mal 3:6]</li> <li><i>Omnipresent</i>; He is present everywhere at the same time and all the time. [Ps 139:7-11]</li> <li>4. <i>Omniscient</i>; He knows all the past, present, and future, and is acquainted with every thought, desire, and purpose of our hearts. [Ps 139:2]</li> <li>5. <i>Omnipotent</i>, or Almighty; He is able to do all things which He wills to do. [Luke 1:37]</li> <li>6. <i>Holy</i>; He is perfectly pure, and separate from all that is evil. [Isa. 6:3]</li> <li>7. <i>Just</i>; He will bless those who keep His law, and punish those who break it. [Rom. 2:6]</li> <li>8. <i>All-wise</i>; He always knows what is the best thing to do, and the best way to do it. [Col. 2:3]</li> <li>9. <i>Good</i>; He is Love itself. [I John 4:8] He is kind even to the unthankful, [Matt. 5:45] merciful to the penitent soul for Jesus' sake, [John 3:16] and longsuffering toward the impenitent in order to lead them to repentance by His goodness. [II Pet. 3:9, Rom. 2:4]</li> <li>10. <i>Faithful and True</i>; He can be absolutely relied upon to do all that He has promised or threatened. [Numb. 23:19]</li> </ol> <p>Because of the Majesty and Goodness of the Lord our God, we should FEAR and LOVE HIM, and KEEP His commandments.</p> <p><strong>QUESTIONS—</strong>1. What do the introductory words show? 2. Of what do the words “I am” remind us? 3. What is the meaning of the Hebrew word translated “Lord”? 4. What do the words “thy God” express? 5. From what bondage has God delivered us? 6. Name and define God’s attributes? 7. Why should we fear and love God?</p> <p><strong>SCRIPTURE VERSES.—</strong>Exod. 3:14.

                "content":"<p>THE CREED, from the Latin <i>Credo, I believe</i>, means that which we as Christians believe. The Creed given in our Catechism is the Apostles' Creed. It is so called, not because it was written by the apostles, but because it contains, in a brief summary, the doctrines which the apostles taught. It grew out of the words of the baptismal formula: “In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.” [Matt 28:19] It has come down to us from the early centuries of the Church’s history, and is her confession of faith. It should be our confession also; we should say from the heart, “I believe in God, etc.” There are</p> <p>Two KINDS OF CREEDS or Confessions of Faith:&mdash;</p> <p>I. <i>Oecumenical</i> or Universal Creeds, which are accepted by the whole Christian Church throughout the world. They are</p> <p>1. The Apostles' Creed.</p> <p>2. The Nicene Creed.</p> <p>3. The Athanasian Creed.</p> <p>II. <i>Particular</i> Creeds or Confessions, which are accepted by the various Churches and Denominations as their distinctive confessions.</p> <p>Our Lutheran Confessions are:&mdash;</p> <p>1. The Augsburg Confession.</p> <p>2. The Apology (Defense) of the Augsburg Confession.</p> <p>3. The Schmalcald Articles.</p> <p>4. The Small Catechism.</p> <p>5. The Large Catechism.</p> <p>6. The Formula of Concord.</p> <p>These nine confessions together form the Book of Concord.</p> <p>THE APOSTLES' CREED CONTAINS, in Three Articles, a statement of what the Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, has done and still does for us.</p> <p>Article I. treats of God the Father and His work of <i>Creation</i>.</p> <p>Article II. treats of God the Son and His work of <i>Redemption</i>.</p> <p>Article III. treats of God the Holy Ghost and His work of <i>Sanctification</i>.</p> <p>THE TRINITY. There is only one God, [Deut. 6:4] but there are three Persons, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Hence, we say that God is the Holy Trinity, or the Three in One. We cannot understand or explain how God can be three Persons and yet only one God. But we must not expect with our finite mind to comprehend the infinite God. We must accept the truth concerning God as He himself has revealed it to us in His Word. He plainly tells us that He is One; for He says, “I am the Lord thy God; thou shalt have no other gods before Me.” [Exod. 20:2-3] Yet He also plainly tells us that there are three Persons. They are expressly mentioned in Christ's command to His disciples, “Go ye, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.” [Matt. 28:19] And they were all revealed at the baptism of Jesus, when the Father spoke from heaven and said, “This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased,” and the Holy Ghost descended on Jesus in the form of a dove. [Matt. 3:16-17] Each Person of the Holy Trinity has a share in the work of our salvation. The Father sent His Son to save us; [John 3:16] the Son became man and died for us; [Rom. 5:8] and the Holy Spirit applies redemption to our souls [I Cor. 12:3] through the Word of God and the Sacraments.</p> <p>QUESTIONS.&mdash;1. Define the word Creed. 2. Why is the Apostles' Creed so called? 3. How did it originate? 4. What two kinds of creeds are there? 5. Name the oecumenical creeds. 6. Name the particular creeds or confessions of the Lutheran Church? 7. What does the Apostles' Creed contain? 8. Of what do the three articles of the Apostles' Creed treat? 9. What is meant by the Holy Trinity? 10. How do we know that God is only one God? 11. How do we know there are three Persons? 12. How do the three Persons of the Trinity share in the work of our salvation?</p>"

                "heading":"CHAPTER XXIII. PRAYER.", 
                "content":"<p>Prayer is the conversation of the believing heart with God. [Ps. 19:14+] It is as necessary for the life of the soul, as breathing is for that of the body. As children of God we must live in communion with Him; and we cannot be Christians without prayer. For this reason God has given us His name to use in prayer, and the Saviour has taught us how to pray in the Lord's Prayer.</p> <p>To WHOM WE SHOULD PRAY. Our prayers should be addressed to God alone, [Matt. 4:10.] and not to the Virgin Mary, the saints, the angels, or any other creatures.</p> <p>WHY WE SHOULD PRAY. We should pray, 1. Because we constantly need God's mercy in temporal and spiritual things. 2. Because we owe God our thanks for his many benefits. [Ps. 103, Jas. 1:17] 3. Because God has commanded us to pray. [Matt. 6:9, Matt. 26:41] 4. Because God has promised to hear us. [Matt. 7:7, 8+, Ps. 50:15]</p> <p>WHEN WE SHOULD PRAY. 1. Always; [Luke 21:36+] that is, our soul should live in constant communion with God, and always be open toward Him. 2. Whenever we feel special need of prayer: in danger, [Matt. 8:25] distress, anxiety, [Matt. 8:25] sickness, [Jas. 5:14, 15] bereavement, sorrow, [Ps. 25:16, 17] temptation, [Matt. 26:41] or when we are burdened with the sense of our guilt. [Luke 18:13.] 3. At fixed times: [Dan. 6:10] every morning and evening, at meal-times; in family worship; [Josh. 24:15+] in church. [Matt. 18:20+]</p> <p>FOR WHOM WE SHOULD PRAY. 1. For ourselves. 2. For our fellow-Christians. [Eph. 6:18+] 3. For all men: [I Tim. 2:1+] for friends and foes, [Matt. 5:44+] the poor and the rich, the afflicted and the tempted. 4. For the Church. 5. For the State.</p> <p>OUR PRAYERS SHOULD CONTAIN: 1. Adoration, 2. Thanksgiving. 3. Confession, 4. Petition. 5. Intercession.</p> <p>THE MANNER. Our prayers should be the sincere utterance of our hearts; otherwise they will be a mere mockery. [Matt. 6:5] They may be in our own words or those of another. It will often be profitable to use the prayers found in good prayer-books or in the Liturgy, and to draw largely from the Psalms, which are a treasury of good and beautiful prayers. We should not lengthen our prayers by vain repetitions, nor repeat the Lord's Prayer or any other prayer a certain number of times as if that were a merit. [Matt. 6:7] Nor should we shorten our prayers through laziness, indifference, and the like. The Lord's Prayer should generally be added to our own prayers as a summary of those things for which we should pray.</p> <p>THE POSTURE which we assume should indicate reverence to God. We should kneel or stand with folded hands. If we are unable to assume either of these postures, we may pray in any position. We stand in church on Sunday, because it is the day of the Lord's resurrection and a day of joy. We should not sit still in church while others stand, unless we are too weak or ill to stand. Kneeling is an attitude of humiliation, particularly appropriate for the confession of sins.</p> <p>IN CHRIST'S NAME. We should always pray in Christ's name, and never omit His name to please men or avoid offence; for our prayers are only heard for Christ's sake. We have the promise that whatever we ask in His name will be given to us. [John 16:23] To pray in Christ's name means to pray, 1. As one who trusts in Christ and asks to be heard for His sake. [Eph. 2:18+, Rom. 5:2] 2. As one who prays in Christ's spirit, submitting all things to God's will, and saying with Christ, “Not my will, but Thine, be done.” [Matt. 26:29, Matt 6:10]</p> <p>IN FAITH. We should pray in faith, believing that God will answer our prayer for Jesus' sake. [Jas. 5:16+] If we do not pray in faith, we shall not be heard. [Jas. 1:6, 7]</p> <p>THE ANSWER TO PRAYER. God always answers the prayer of the believer. Those who ask and receive not, have either asked amiss, [Jas. 4:3] or have not asked in faith. If we ask anything according to His will, He heareth us. [John 5:14+] He answers our prayer, 1. By granting us what we ask, though perhaps after a long delay, by which He tries our faith and patience. 2. He grants us good things instead of the hurtful things for which we ignorantly ask. 3. He gives us strength to bear the burden which we pray to have removed, [II Cor. 12:9] and thus confers a greater blessing than the removal of the burden would be.</p> <p>QUESTIONS.&mdash;1. What is prayer? 2. To whom alone should we pray? 3. Why should we pray? 4. When should we pray? 5. For whom should we pray? 6. What should our prayers contain? 7.

For everyone that asketh receiveth, and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.</p> <p>Luke 21:36. Watch ye, therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.</p> <p>Josh. 24:15.

Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints.</p> <p>I Tim. 2:1, 2. I exhort, therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for all men; for kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.</p> <p>Matt. 5:44. Pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you.</p> <p>Eph. 2:18. For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father.</p> <p>Jas. 5:16. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.</p> <p>I John 5:14. And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask anything according to his will, he heareth us.</p> <p>II Cor. 12:9.

                "content":"<p>Human life is sacred. It is man's most precious earthly possession; for without it he cannot enjoy any other. This commandment is meant to guard it. We dare not shorten another person's life, nor our own. God gives life, and He alone has the right to take it away.</p> <p>This commandment <i>forbids</i> us to kill or injure other persons or ourselves. It <i>commands</i> us to assist and comfort our neighbor in danger and want.</p> <p>I. WHAT is FORBIDDEN.</p> <p>We must not</p> <center>1. KILL OR INJURE OTHER PERSONS.</center> <p><i>Murder</i>. To destroy any human life, even if it be very young or yet unborn, is a great crime. He who commits murder is to be punished with death. [Gen. 9:6+] Among the motives which prompt to murder are anger, hatred, [Gen. 4:1-8] envy, [Gen. 37] jealousy, revenge, [Matt. 14:3-11, Rom. 12:19+] frivolity, avarice, robbery, and a desire to hide past sin. [II Sam. 11] We must be on our guard against all that would ever tempt us to this great crime.</p> <p><i>Duels</i>. It is foolish as well as sinful to pretend to establish the right or wrong of a question by a duel.</p> <p><i>Unjust Wars</i> are wholesale murder. Rulers must do all that they honorably can to prevent war. Yet as a last resort to maintain the right, war is justifiable.</p> <p><i>Hatred</i> is murder in the heart. “He that hateth his brother is a murderer.” [I John 3:15, Matt. 5:21, 22+, Eph. 4:31, 32+]</p> <p><i>Tempting Others</i> to useless risks in which they may perish or be injured, or to drunkenness, dissipation, etc. which will shorten their life, is a transgression of this commandment.</p> <p><i>Causing Accidents</i> by neglect, carelessness or bad workmanship, or</p> <p><i>Shortening Other People's Lives</i> [Gen. 37:31-35] by maltreatment, overwork, worriment, etc. makes men guilty of sin against this commandment.</p> <p><i>Neglect to Warn</i> others of impending danger <i>or neglect to assist</i> them in need may result in their injury or death.</p> <p>The law recognizes our right to defend our life when it is unjustly assailed. But killing others in self-defense must he our last resort. Many persons act hastily. The official who inflicts the death penalty on condemned criminals is not guilty of wrong, but is doing his duty as an officer of the State. [Rom 13:4]</p> <p>It is a sin to kill our neighbor's <i>soul</i> by tempting him to sin, or enticing him to wrong-doing by our evil example.</p> <p>We must not</p> <p>2.&mdash;KILL OR INJURE OURSELVES.</p> <p>Suicide is often prompted by despair, remorse, [Matt. 27:35] cowardice, recklessness, or insanity. But it is sinful as well as foolish and cowardly. He who commits it robs himself of the opportunity to repent, and leaves others to bear the burdens from which he shrank. If we are tempted to despair, we should not commit suicide, but seek comfort and strength in God's Word. If we have fallen into disgrace by sin, we should repent and lead a better life.</p> <p><i>Duels</i>. We not only have no right to endanger another's life by a duel, but we have no right to endanger our own. The duel, which was once a common practice, has justly fallen under the condemnation of public opinion.</p> <p><i>A Life of Sin</i>. Impurity, drunkenness, gluttony, or dissipation will shorten our life, and make us die before our allotted time.</p> <p><i>Disregard of the Laws of Health</i>, overwork, needless exposure, carelessness, violent anger, needless worry, are all forbidden by this commandment.</p> <p>The voluntary sacrifice of our life for truth and right (martyrdom), or in defense of our country, or in an effort to rescue and save others, is not only justifiable but noble. [I John 3:16]</p> <center>II. WHAT IS COMMANDED.</center> <p>We should ASSIST AND COMFORT OUR NEIGHBOR.

It <i>commands</i> chastity and purity in thought, word, and deed.</p> <center>I. PURITY.</center> <p>We should be CHASTE AND PURE</p> <p><i>In Heart.</i> We should keep our heart free from impure thoughts and desires. [Matt. 5:8+, Prov. 4:23+, Ps. 51:10] God judges us by the state of our heart. [I Sam. 16:7] Unchaste thoughts must not be delighted in nor harbored, but subdued and stamped out. They poison the soul. They are themselves a transgression of this commandment, [Matt. 5:28+] and they lead to further transgressions of it by word and deed.</p> <p>IN WORDS. We must avoid immodest conversation, unchaste words, vile stories, and shameless jests. [Eph. 5:3-4, Eph. 4:29+] Such things are not smart, as many think, but vile and despicable. We should never take part in nor listen to a conversation which we would be ashamed to have overheard by persons whom we respect.</p> <p>IN DEEDS. We should carefully avoid every act which would bring the blush of shame to our cheeks if it were known to our parents or others whose opinion we cherish. Our bodies are to be God's temple, [I Cor. 6:19, 20+] and they dare not be given over to sin and impurity. [Rom. 6:13] We should remember that God sees even in secret, and knows all our actions. [Ps. 139:1-12]</p> <p><i>Impurity</i> of heart and life will not go unpunished. [I Cor. 3:16, 17+, Gal. 5:19-21+] It is often followed by the most dreadful consequences: a ruined body, an enfeebled mind, a poisoned soul, a tortured conscience, public shame, dreadful disease and an untimely death.</p> <p><i>To Keep ourselves Pure</i> we should watch and pray, [Matt. 26:41+] avoid idleness, evil company, bad books and papers, indecent songs and pictures, immoral plays, intemperance in eating and drinking, and all that would incite to impurity. We should keep our minds occupied with good thoughts and desires, so that we have no room for evil ones. [Rom. 13:14]</p> <center>II. MARRIAGE.</center> <p>Marriage is the union of one man and one woman for life in the bonds of love and faithfulness.</p> <p><i>A Holy Estate</i>. Marriage was instituted by God in Eden [Gen. 2:13] and was sanctioned by Christ, who performed His first miracle at a wedding. [John 2:1-11] It is a holy estate. Celibacy is not a holier estate than marriage, as the Roman Catholic Church maintains. [I Tim. 4:1-3]</p> <p><i>Indissoluble</i>. The marriage tie is binding until one of the married persons dies. [Matt. 19:6+] Except by death, the marriage relation cannot be broken or dissolved without sin against this sixth commandment. [Matt. 5:32+, Matt 19:9] If one party to the marriage is guilty of adultery, the innocent party may obtain a divorce. No other divorces are allowed by Christ.</p> <p><i>An Important Step</i>. Marriage is a most important step in life. It must not be entered into hastily or thoughtlessly. If a mistake is made in the choice of a partner for life, the mistake can never be remedied. Those who contemplate such a step should pray for God's guidance. Marriage should not be entered upon for money, social advantages, and the like, but for love. Parents should be consulted. While marriage by a civil magistrate is valid, Christians should seek God's blessing upon their union and be married by His ordained servant. The laws of the State must be carefully obeyed. Marriage between near relatives is forbidden by God's Word. [Lev. 18] Those who are married should, if possible, be of the same faith. Marriages between Protestants and Roman Catholics are seldom happy.</p> <p><i>Duty of Husband</i> [Eph. 5:25+, Col. 3:19] <i>and Wife.</i> [Eph. 5:22+, Col. 3:18] EACH SHOULD LOVE AND HONOR HIS WIFE OR HER HUSBAND. The man is the head of the family, but he must not be a tyrant. The wife is not his slave, but his dearest companion. They are no longer two but one, with a common love, a common life, a common property, common children, common hopes and aspirations, and a common Saviour. [I Pet. 3:7, I Pet. 3:1] They should be patient with one another's faults, just to one another's virtues, and should unselfishly seek one another's happiness. They should live together in mutual love and faithfulness till separated by death. Only when husband and wife continue to love and honor one another can they be happy. The breaking of the marriage covenant is followed by shame and misery.</p> <p>QUESTIONS.&mdash;1. What is this commandment meant to preserve and guard? 2. What does it forbid and command? 3.

Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy: for the temple of God is holy; which temple ye are.</p> <p>Gal. 5:19-21. Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these, adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which, do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.</p> <p>Matt. 26:41, Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.</p> <p>Matt. 19: 6.

Without such protection the individual could not support his life, and society could not exist. The industrious and thrifty would be at the mercy of the lazy and wicked. This commandment <i>forbids</i> us to use dishonest means of acquiring property. It <i>commands</i> us to assist our neighbor to improve and protect his own.</p> <p>PROPERTY consists of whatever each person lawfully acquires of the earth's lands, forests, water, mines, houses, goods or money. It may be rightfully acquired by original claim, inheritance, gift, or labor of body or mind. Honest labor united with economy is the best way to acquire it.</p> <p>UNEQUAL DIVISION. God, who is the absolute owner of all things, [I Cor. 10:26] divides to each as He will. [Jer. 27:5] He “maketh poor and maketh rich.” [I Sam. 2:7, Prov. 22:2+] Much poverty, however, is due to men’s own laziness, idleness, [II Thess. 3:10+] carelessness or extravagance; and much wealth has been wrongfully gained contrary to God’s will as expressed in this commandment. <i>Communism</i>, or the equal division of property among all men, is not practicable. It failed in the apostolic Church. [Acts 5:1-10] If all things were equally divided, some would soon clamor for another division.</p> <p>POVERTY AND RICHES. The happiest person is he who is neither rich nor poor, but has sufficient for his needs. [Prov. 30:7-9+, Prov. 15:16-17+] Poverty may tempt a man to dishonesty; and riches may lead him to avarice, hardness of heart, worldliness and extravagance. [I Tim. 6:9, 10, I Tim. 6:17+] Riches make it hard for a man to enter into the kingdom of God. [Matt. 19:24+, Matt. 13:22] We should respect men for what they are, and not for what they have. We should not flatter the rich nor despise the poor. [Jas. 2:1-4]</p> <p>USE OF PROPERTY. God entrusts earthly property to us as His stewards. [Luke 19:12-27, Matt. 25:14-30, Luke 16:1-8] Whether we are rich or poor, we should so use our property as to be able to give an account to God. <i>For ourselves</i> and those dependent on us [I Tim. 5:8+] we should use it for the supply of our bodily needs (food, clothing, shelter, a reasonable amount of pleasure) and of our spiritual needs [Luke 12:15+, Matt. 6:33, I Cor. 9:14] (the Church and the Gospel). <i>For our fellow-men</i> we should, when necessary, use it according to our ability for their bodily needs (the poor) and their spiritual needs (Home and Foreign Missions). [Matt. 22:39]</p> <center>I. WHAT IS FORBIDDEN.</center> <p>1. ROBBING OUR NEIGHBOR. The grossest forms of dishonesty are Robbery, Theft, Burglary, Embezzlement, and Forgery. These are recognized by all as wrong. But it is also wrong to bring our neighbor's property into our possession, by</p> <p>2. UNFAIR DEALING AND FRAUDULENT MEANS, [Prov. 29:24, Lev. 6:2, 3, Ps. 37:21, Jer. 22:13, Lev. 19:35, 36, Hab. 2:6, Prov. 15:6, Deut. 24:14, Jas. 5:4, Prov. 11:1] such as Concealing stolen property, Withholding lost or borrowed property, Evading taxes, Refusing to pay debts, Wilful idleness and beggary, Betting and gambling, Lotteries and chancing, Bribery, Useless lawsuits, Negligent management of another's property, Stealing car-rides, Unfaithful labor, Insufficient wages, Cornering the market, Overcharging, Usury, Adulterating goods, Giving short weight or measure, and Cheating of any kind.</p> <p>3. <i>Dishonesty in the Heart</i>. Dishonesty has its source in the covetousness and greed of the human heart. [Mic. 2:2] Men first covet, and then steal or defraud. We must beware of covetousness. [Luke 12:15+] The love of money is a root of all evil. [I Tim. 6:10+] We must be honest even in small matters. He who is dishonest in little will be dishonest in much. [Luke 16:10] We must avoid all that would tempt us to dishonesty; namely, evil companions, idleness, speculation, extravagance, etc.</p> <center>II. WHAT IS COMMANDED.</center> <p>We should</p> <p>1. ASSIST OUR NEIGHBOR TO IMPROVE AND PROTECT HIS PROPERTY. [Exod. 23:4, 5, Matt. 7:12] We should help him to get along well in the world, and do what we can to prevent him from being deprived of his possessions.</p> <p>2. <i>Restore to the real owner</i> whatever has been dishonestly gotten. [Luke 19:8]</p> <p>3. <i>Be Ready to use our money</i> and property in order to help and benefit our neighbor.

[Ps. 34:13+] False witness against other <i>persons</i> is the worst form of lying.

We must not</p> <p>BELIE him, that is, tell an untruth about him.</p> <p>BETRAY. [Prov. 11:13+, Prov. 24:28] We must not abuse our neighbor's confidence by revealing his innocent secrets, and thus annoying or harming him.

The slanderer is worse than a thief and causes incalculable suffering and misery. [Prov. 25:18+, Jas. 3:5-8] We should remember that words once spoken live on for good or evil, and cannot be unsaid; and that we must give an account to God for every word we speak.

[I Sam. 16:7+, Matt. 5:5] All the commandments must, indeed, be kept in thought as well as in word and deed. But by adding these two special commandments against coveting, God desires to impress upon us most strongly that wrong thoughts and desires make us guilty before Him. We are not keeping God's commandments unless we are free from the <i>desire</i> to transgress them. As a man “thinketh in his heart, so is he.” [Prov. 23:7]</p> <p>THE HEART BY NATURE SINFUL. We are born with a sinful nature and a natural inclination to evil (Original sin), which we have inherited from our ancestors as a result of the fall into sin. [John 3:6+, Jer. 17:9] This natural inclination to evil manifests itself in wrong thoughts and desires which arise in the heart. [Rom. 7:18, 19+] These wrong desires or lusts are in themselves sinful: and if they are not subdued, they lead to sins of words and deeds.

But we must not have</p> <p>1. <i>An Unlawful Desire</i> [Gal. 5:24+] for our neighbor's possessions, whether it be his property, wife, servants, cattle, or anything that is his. We must not envy him on account of them, nor begrudge them to him, nor wish that we had them in his stead.

He will punish or bless men according as they hate or love Him: [Rom. 2:6-10, Deut. 11:26-28, Gal. 6:7-8] “to the third and fourth generation of them that hate him,” and “unto thousands of them that love Him and keep His commandments.”</p> <center>I. PUNISHMENT.</center> <center>GOD THREATENS TO PUNISH</center> <p>1. <i>Whom?</i> ALL THOSE WHO TRANSGRESS THESE COMMANDMENTS [Rom: 1:18+, Lev 26:14-15, Isa 59:2, Ezek. 18:4+, Rom. 6:23+] by commission, (doing what is forbidden) or omission (not doing what is commanded), whether it be transgression by deed or word or thought. Every transgression, great or small, is sin, and makes men guilty and punishable. [Gal. 3:10]</p> <p>2. <i>Why?</i> Because justice demands it. [Gal. 6:7+] God cannot be unjust. He cannot overlook or excuse sin. [Eccl. 11:9] Earthly governments must and do punish offenders, or they would be unjust to those persons who obey the law. A law without a penalty would amount to nothing. God, who governs the universe, is and must be just. [Gen. 18:25+]</p> <p>3. <i>How?</i></p> <p><i>In this World</i> God punishes sin by Pangs of Conscience; [Matt. 26:75, Matt. 27:3-4] Pains and Sufferings which are the results of wrong-doing, [Jer. 17:10] <i>e.g.</i>, the results of drunkenness and licentiousness; Legal Penalties which the State, as God's servant to punish crime, inflicts by fines, imprisonment and hanging; [Rom. 13:4] Special Judgments upon individuals [1 Cor. 10:5] in the form of sickness, accidents and reverses, though we must remember that afflictions are not always a judgment, but are often sent upon the godly as a chastening; [Heb. 12:6+] General Judgments upon wicked communities, such as that which God sent upon Sodom and Gomorrah. [Gen. 19:24]</p> <p>Children are often obliged to suffer for the sins of their parents. [Jer. 31:29] If the children also are wicked, their sufferings are a punishment; [Ezek. 18:20, Prov. 3:12, Rom. 8:28] if they are godly, their sufferings are a chastening.</p> <p><i>In the Next World</i> God will punish by Exclusion from Heaven and from His Presence; [Matt. 22:13] and by Eternal Misery in Hell.

It is true, all men are sinners, and no one keeps these commandments perfectly. [Rom. 3:23+] But the godly try earnestly to keep them, [I Cor. 9:27] and are truly sorry for every failure to do so. [Rom. 7:24] To them, therefore, God promises grace and every blessing.</p> <p>2. <i>Why?</i> God will bless them, not because they have earned a reward, but because He is merciful and gracious. [Ps. 103:11+, Joel 2:13] We cannot earn anything from God but punishment. His blessing is bestowed upon us solely as a gift of grace.</p> <p>3. <i>How?</i></p> <p><i>In this World</i> God blesses the godly with: Peace of Heart; [John 14:27] His Favor and Guidance; [Ps. 34:15+] True Success in Life; [Rom. 8:28] and a Blessed Hope of Salvation. [Rev. 2:10+]</p> <p>Children and remote descendants share in the blessing of godly ancestors.</p> <p><i>In the Next World</i> God will grant them: Entrance into Heaven for Christ's Sake; [Matt. 25:34] and Eternal Glory and Blessedness.

WE SHOULD THEREFORE DREAD HIS DISPLEASURE, AND NOT ACT CONTRARILY TO THESE COMMANDMENTS.</p> <p>AN ENCOURAGEMENT. A <i>godly life</i> will bring upon us God's blessing in time and eternity.

[John 1:8-10+, Rom 3:23, Eccl 7:20, Jas 2:10+]</p> <p>We are not able to keep them perfectly. [Rom 7:18-19] Consequently we cannot be saved by them. [Gal 3:11] They are meant to show us our sinfulness, [Rom 3:20] to lead us to repentance, and to direct as to Christ for salvation. [Gal 3:24] We can be saved only through Him.

[Ps. 102:25] He has made all things,&mdash;the universe and all that it contains. The world did not come into being of itself or by chance, nor did it exist from eternity. God made it out of nothing. In the beginning He created the heaven and the earth. [Gen. 1:1+, Ps 33:6, 9] They were at first a formless mass; [Gen. 1:2] but in six days God fashioned the formless mass into the world as it now exists. On these six days He created, 1. Light, 2.

CREATED ME [Job. 33:4+] AND ALL THAT EXISTS; [Neh. 9:6, Col. 1:16+] THAT HE HAS GIVEN TO ME</p> <p>MY BODY,&mdash;WITH ALL MY LIMBS AND SENSES. Though my body, like that of the beasts, is made of the dust of the ground, [Gen. 2:7+] it is vastly superior to their bodies, and is a marvelous piece of divine workmanship, [Ps. 139:14] exquisitely adapted to be the earthly tabernacle of the soul which inhabits it.</p> <p>MY SOUL, [Gen. 2:7+]&mdash;MY REASON AND ALL THE FACULTIES OF MY MIND, by which I am placed so far above the brute creation. God made the human soul to be a likeness of Himself; [Gen. 1:27, Gen. 9:6] that is, He gave to man in a limited measure those powers and faculties which He Himself possesses in unlimited and infinite measure. And while the human mind has become dimmed by the fall, its powers and faculties are still most wonderful.</p> <p>2. PRESERVES ME. [Neh. 9:6] All that has helped to support my life has been God's gift; namely, MY RAIMENT, FOOD, HOME AND FAMILY, AND ALL MY PROPERTY. I continue to live because He sustains me. [Jas. 1:17+, Acts 17:28+]</p> <p>HE DAILY PROVIDES ME ABUNDANTLY WITH ALL THE NECESSARIES OF LIFE. [Ps. 115:15-16+] His care for me is a constant, daily care. His mercies are new every morning.

[Ps. 103:13+] It is</p> <p>PATERNAL or fatherly [Ps 103:13+] goodness and mercy, because He is my Father through Jesus Christ, and loves me as His child. It is</p> <p>DIVINE goodness and mercy, because God is love, [I John 4:16+] and only His unspeakable love could move Him to bestow His great benefits upon sinful men, even upon the wicked and unthankful. [Matt. 5:45+]</p> <p>2. WITHOUT ANY MERIT OR WORTHINESS IN ME. [Gen. 32:10+] I have merited (deserved) nothing and I am worthy of nothing but punishment; for I am a sinful being, [Ps. 51:5] and I have broken God's law many times by thoughts and words and deeds.

                "content":"<p>The Second Article treats of Jesus Christ, THE SON OF GOD, and his work of REDEMPTION. Prompted by His infinite love, God pitied our lost race, and determined to save us by sending a Redeemer in the person of His only Son. [John 3:16+, I Tim. 1:15+] Throughout the centuries of Old Testament history He repeatedly gave the promise of redemption: In Eden, [Gen. 3:15] to the patriarchs, [Gen. 12:3, Gen. 26:4] to David, [II Sam. 7:12-13] and through the prophets. [Isa. 9:2-7, Mic. 5:2] In the fulness of time God seat His Son into the world. [Gal. 4:4]</p> <p>Article II. and its Explanation may be analyzed as follows:&mdash;</p> <center>I. OUR LORD.</center> <p>1. <i>His Names</i>: Jesus, Christ.</p> <p>2. <i>His Person and Nature</i>: True God and True Man.</p> <p>3. <i>His Life</i>: His Humiliation and His Exaltation.</p> <center>II. HIS WORK OF REDEMPTION.</center> <p>1. <i>Whom He has redeemed.</i></p> <p>2. <i>From what He has redeemed me.</i></p> <p>3. <i>How He has redeemed me.</i></p> <p>4. <i>Why He has redeemed me.</i></p> <center>OUR LORD.</center> <center>I. HIS NAMES.</center> <center>I BELIEVE THAT</center> <p>JESUS. This was our Lord’s personal name, given to Him by the angel. [Matt. 1:21] It signified, “He shall save.”</p> <p>CHRIST. This was His official name, corresponding with the Old Testament name “Messiah,” [John 1:41] and signified “The Anointed One.” God anointed Him with the Holy Spirit for the work of redemption, [Luke 4:18-21] to a threefold office:&mdash;</p> <p>1. As Prophet, to teach us God's will. [Acts 3:22]</p> <p>2. As Priest, to atone for our sins, and to intercede for us. [Heb. 4:14]</p> <p>3. As King, [Matt. 21:5, Rev. 17:14] to reign over us in the Kingdom of Power, of Grace, and of Glory.</p> <center>II. HIS PERSON AND NATURE.</center> <p>He is</p> <p>TRUE GOD, BEGOTTEN OF THE FATHER FROM ETERNITY. Christ is true God, [Rom. 9:5+] just as the Father is God. [John 5:23+, John 20:28+, John 8:58+, Mat. 16:16] He is the Son of God, not as a good or great man who has been received or adopted as God's son, but He is in His very nature the Son of God, <i>begotten by His Father</i> [John 3:16+] <i>from all eternity</i>. [John 1:1, John 17:5]He is “God of God, Light of Light, Very God of Very God, Begotten, not made, being of one substance with the Father.” [John 10:30+] The Scriptures show this by ascribing to Him divine names, attributes, power, honor, and works. At His baptism and at His transfiguration the Father spoke from heaven, and said, “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.” [Matt. 3:17, Matt. 17:5] His divine nature is proved by His teaching, His miracles, His holy life, and especially by His resurrection from the dead.</p> <p>ALSO TRUE MAN, BORN OF THE VIRGIN MARY. Christ was in all respects a human being such as we are, except that He was without sin. [I Pet. 2:22+] He was “conceived by the Holy Ghost,” and thus had God alone for His Father. [Luke 1:35] But He was “born of the Virgin Mary,” [Luke 2:7] with a human body [Heb. 2:14] and soul. [Matt. 26:38] He grew, increased in wisdom and stature, [Luke 2:52] and reached the age of manhood. He suffered our human wants, [Matt. 4:2, John 4:6-7] such as hunger, thirst, weariness, and pain. He was moved by human emotions, [Luke 10:21, Matt. 26:38, Matt. 21:12] such as joy, sorrow, and indignation. He wept, [John 11:35] prayed, [Matt. 26:39] suffered, and died. [I Pet. 2:23-24] He could not have done these things if He had not been true man.</p> <p>Christ is therefore both God and man in one Person. [Rom. 1:3-4, John 1:14+] Consequently He is the <i>God-Man.</i> It was necessary that the Redeemer should be both God and man. [I Tim. 1:15+] If He had not been God, but only man, He could not have paid a sufficient ransom for our deliverance from sin, nor have acquired any merit to bestow upon us. Even a sinless man could have saved no one but himself. On the other hand, if Christ had not become man, but remained God only, He could not have put Himself in our place under the law, nor have suffered and died in our stead. But as the <i>God-man</i>, Christ was able to accomplish, and did perfectly accomplish, our redemption. [Rom. 3:24+] Thus He became and</p> <p>IS MY LORD, WHO HAS REDEEMED ME, and in whom I trust for salvation. [Rom. 8:38-39, Rom. 5:1+]</p> <p>QUESTIONS.&mdash;1.

For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</p> <p>I Tim. 1:15. This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.</p> <p>Rom. 9:5. Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever.</p> <p>John 5:23. That all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him.</p> <p>John 20:28. And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God.</p> <p>John 8:58. Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.</p> <p>John 10:30. I and my Father are one.</p> <p>I Pet. 2:22. Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth.</p> <p>John 1:14.

                "content":"<center>III. HIS LIFE.</center> <p>The Saviour's life includes two states; namely, His Humiliation and His Exaltation.</p> <center>HIS HUMILIATION.</center> <p>Christ's state of humiliation comprises His life on earth, during which He laid aside the full use of His divine glory and was content to appear among men in the form of a servant. He humbled Himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross, [Phil. 2:8+] in order that He might redeem us. He gave men glimpses of His divine glory: in the authority with which He taught, [Matt. 7:28-29] in the holy life which He led, [John 8:46] and in the miracles which He performed. [John 2:11] But in general He appeared like other men.</p> <p>This state of humiliation includes five stages:&mdash;He was</p> <p>1. CONCEIVED BY THE HOLY GHOST, BORN OF THE VIRGIN MARY. Christ might have appeared among men in the full splendor of His divine glory and majesty. But, in order to redeem us, He was content to be born in poverty, [Luke 2:7, II Cor. 8:9+, Matt. 8:20+] to grow up in obscurity, [Matt. 2:23] and to appear to most men as if He were simply a man.</p> <p>2. SUFFERED UNDER PONTIUS PILATE. The whole life of Jesus on earth was a life of suffering endured for our sakes. He bore all the trials and hardships which have come upon our race as a result of its sinfulness. He also suffered constant persecution at the hands of his enemies. [Heb. 12:3; John 1:11] But His greatest sufferings came at the end of His life, in the agony of Gethsemane, [Matt. 26:36-46] in the mock-trial before the Jewish Council, [Matt. 26:57-75] and in His sufferings under Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor. [Matt. 27:1-30] He was mocked, spitefully entreated, spitted on, crowned with thorns, and scourged; and then He</p> <p>3. WAS CRUCIFIED. [Luke 23:33] Though innocent and holy, He was treated as though He were a malefactor, and was put to a cruel and shameful death. He was nailed to a cross, and left suspended there till He died. So great was His agony, that He cried out, “My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?”[Mark 15:34]</p> <p>4. DEAD. After unspeakable sufferings, Jesus died on the cross. [Mark 15:37] He was really, and not seemingly, dead. [John 19:33-34] He voluntarily gave up His life for ours. [John 10:18-19+] His death was <i>vicarious</i>. He suffered the penalty for our sins. [I Pet. 3:18, Isa. 53:5+]</p> <p>5. BURIED. His body was laid away in the grave, where our bodies shall decay. But since Christ was “the Holy One of God,” His body could not “see corruption.”[Ps. 16:10]</p> <center>HIS EXALTATION.</center> <p>After the work of redemption was completed, Christ assumed the full use of the glory and majesty which had belonged to Him as the Son of God from eternity; His human nature was exalted to a full share in the glory of His divine nature. [Phil. 2:9-11+] He had humbled Himself as a man; and He was exalted as a man. His divine nature, being unchangeable, can neither be humbled nor exalted. [Heb. 13:8]</p> <p>Christ's exaltation, like His humiliation, includes five stages:&mdash;</p> <p>1. HE DESCENDED INTO HELL. Immediately before His resurrection He descended into the place of the departed spirits and proclaimed His victory. [I Pet. 3:19]</p> <p>2. THE THIRD DAY HE ROSE AGAIN FROM THE DEAD. Having paid in full the penalty for our sins, He rose again from the dead, triumphant, on the third day (Easter). He had power to lay down His life, and power to take it again. [John 10:19] As His death had been a real death, so His resurrection was a real resurrection. He re-appeared to His disciples, not as a spirit, but with the same body that was crucified, the prints of the nails and of the spear being plain in His hands and side. [Luke 24:36-40] But His body was a transformed and glorified body, with new properties and powers. [John 20:19]</p> <p><i>The Resurrection a Fact</i>. The reality of the resurrection is established beyond all doubt. The strongest proof of its reality is found in the fact that the disciples themselves were so unwilling to believe it, but were obliged to do so by the evidence of their own senses. Even the doubting Thomas exclaimed, “My Lord, and my God.” [John 20:28] During the forty days between His resurrection and His ascension the Lord gave His disciples so many proofs of His resurrection that all their doubts were removed. [Acts 1:3] The women on Easter morn found the grave empty and were told by an angel that He had risen. [Mark 16:6] He was seen by Mary in the Garden, [John 20:14-16] by Peter, [Luke 24:34] by the two disciples at Emmaus, [Luke 24:15] twice by the eleven as they were gathered together, [John 20:19-29] by seven disciples at the Sea of Tiberias, [John 21:1] by more than five hundred brethren at once, [I Cor. 15:6] by James, [I Cor. 15:7] and by the eleven when He accompanied them to Mount Olivet and ascended before their eyes to heaven. [Acts 1:9-12] The wonderful change which took place in the apostles when the risen and ascended Christ had sent the Holy Spirit upon them, [Acts 2] and the wonderful change which took place in Paul, [Acts 9:1-29] are further proofs of the reality of the resurrection of Christ.</p> <p><i>The Resurrection proves</i> 1. That Jesus is the Son of God. [John 20:28, Rom. 1:4+, Acts 2:36] 2. That the sacrifice which He made for sin was sufficient and accepted. [Rom. 8:34, I Thess. 1:10] 3. That we also shall rise from the dead. [Rom. 4:25+, I Cor. 15:19-20+, I Cor. 6:14]</p> <p>3. HE ASCENDED INTO HEAVEN from Mount Olivet forty days after His resurrection. [Acts 1:9] Having finished His work on earth, He returned to the heaven from which He had come. He has gone to prepare a place for us. [Acts 14:2]</p> <p>4. AND SITTETH ON THE RIGHT HAND OF GOD THE FATHER ALMIGHTY; that is, on the right hand of God's power. As the God-man He now wields all power in heaven and earth. [Matt. 28:18+, Eph. 1:20-22+] He rules over all creatures in the realm of Power; over the believers in the realm of Grace (the Church on earth); and over angels and saints in the realm of Glory in heaven. He continues His office of High-priest, and intercedes for us with the Father. [Rom. 8:34+, Heb. 4:14-16]</p> <p>5. FROM THENCE HE SHALL COME TO JUDGE THE QUICK AND THE DEAD. At the end of the world Christ will come again visibly, [Mark 13:26+] suddenly, and unexpectedly, [Matt. 24:36-42, Luke 21:27] with power and great glory, to judge both the quick (living) and the dead. [II Cor. 5:10+, Matt. 25:31-46] He will separate the believing from the unbelieving; receive the believers unto Himself; and cast the impenitent and unbelieving into outer darkness and torment. His coming will fill the believers with joy, [Luke 21:28] and the unbelievers with dismay. [Rev. 6:15-17] No one knows or can compute the exact time of His coming. We should be always ready. [Matt. 24:42, 44+] His coming will be preceded by signs. [Luke 21:25-26] The present order of the world shall pass away; [II Pet. 5:10] and there shall be new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.

                "content":"<center>I. WHOM HE HAS REDEEMED.</center> <p>He HAS REDEEMED</p> <p>ME. Christ died for all; [I Pet. 2:24+, I John 2:2+, John 1:29+] and consequently for me also. [Gal. 2:20+] Believing on Him, all the blessings of His redemption belong to me In time and in eternity. He is <i>my</i> Saviour, <i>my</i> Redeemer.</p> <p>A LOST AND CONDEMNED CREATURE. I was lost, [Isa. 53:6+, I Pet. 2:25] because my sin had separated me from God, and I could not have found my way back to Him, if Christ had not sought and found me. I was condemned, [Eph. 2:3] because I had broken God's commandments and deserved eternal punishment.</p> <center>II. FROM WHAT HE HAS REDEEMED ME.</center> <p>He has SECURED AND DELIVERED ME</p> <p>FROM ALL SINS; namely, from the <i>guilt</i> of sin by paying its penalty for me on the cross; [I John 1:7, II Cor. 5:21+] and from the <i>dominion</i> of sin by giving me grace to fight against it and overcome it. [Rom 6:14, Rom. 8:2-4]</p> <p>FROM DEATH: not from bodily death, for even the Christian must die; but from the fear of bodily death; [Phil. 1:23, I Cor. 15:55, 57] from spiritual death; [Eph. 2:6] and from everlasting death. [John 3:16]</p> <p>AND FROM THE POWER OF THE DEVIL. [I John 3:8+] On account of my sins, I was in Satan's power. But Christ has freed me. Since He has paid the penalty for my sins, Satan no longer has any claim upon me, and can no longer harm me. [John 10:27-28] He still tempts me to sin; but Christ gives me grace to resist. He still accuses me before God on account of my sins; but Christ shields me against Satan's accusations by the satisfaction which He, my Saviour, has made for all my sins. [I John 2:1]</p> <center>III. HOW HE HAS REDEEMED ME.</center> <p>NOT WITH SILVER AND GOLD; [I Pet. 1:18, 19+] for no material wealth could purchase freedom from spiritual slavery and death. Nor has He redeemed me merely by becoming my great teacher and example; for this would not take away my guilt;</p> <p>BUT WITH HIS HOLY AND PRECIOUS BLOOD. [I John 1:7+] His blood was the price which Christ paid for my ransom. It was holy, because He was holy; and precious, because He was the Son of God. The shedding of Christ's blood for my sins was the only way in which I could be redeemed; for without the shedding of blood, there is no remission of sins. [Heb. 9:22]</p> <p>AND WITH HIS INNOCENT SUFFERINGS [I Pet. 3:18+] AND DEATH. [Rom. 5:7-8+] Christ suffered and died, not for any sins of His own, but for <i>my</i> sins. He was innocent and had no sin at all. But He voluntarily bore the punishment which I deserved, and thus satisfied all the demands of divine justice for me. Since He has borne the punishment for me, I, believing on Him, need no longer be punished.</p> <p><i>Christ was my Substitute.</i> By His holy life He perfectly fulfilled God's law in my place; [Rom 5:19] and by His innocent sufferings and death He bore the punishment for my sins in my place. [II Cor. 5:21+] All that Christ has done is imputed to me by faith; [Rom. 4:24] that is, it is all counted as if I myself had done it. [Rom. 4:5] His death, therefore, frees me from guilt and condemnation; and His holy life makes me appear righteous In God's sight and fit to enter into heaven. My entire hope of salvation rests on Christ and what He has done for me. [II Cor. 5:19]</p> <center>IV. WHY HE HAS REDEEMED ME.</center> <center>IN ORDER THAT</center> <p>I MIGHT BE HIS. He desired me for His own, and therefore purchased me with His precious blood. [II Cor. 5:15+] Hence I now belong to Him, and not to Satan or to myself. He wishes me to yield myself fully to Him in heart and life.

                "content":"<p>THE THIRD ARTICLE treats of GOD THE HOLY GHOST and His work of SANCTIFICATION. It tells us how we become partakers of the Redemption which is described in the Second Article. Christ <i>has accomplished</i> our redemption, and the Holy Ghost <i>applies</i> that redemption to our souls. The work of the Holy Ghost <i>in</i> us is as necessary for our salvation as the [Cor. 2:14] work of Christ <i>for</i> us. We must believe in Christ, if we would be saved; [Mark 16:16] and it is the Holy Ghost who causes us to believe. [1 Cor. 12:3]</p> <p>Article. III, and its Explanation may be analyzed as follows:&mdash;</p> <center>THE HOLY GHOST,</center> <p>I. <i>His Person and Nature</i>: He is True God.</p> <p>II. <i>His Work</i>: He Calls, Enlightens, Sanctifies, and Preserves me in the true Faith.</p> <p>III. <i>His Workmanship</i>: The Holy Christian Church.</p> <p>IV. <i>The Fruits of His Work</i>: 1. The Forgiveness of Sins. 2. The Resurrection of the Body, and the Life Everlasting.</p> <center>THE HOLY GHOST.</center> <center>I. HIS PERSON AND NATURE.</center> <p>I BELIEVE IN THE HOLY GHOST. The Holy Ghost is true God. He is not simply a power or energy of God, but a Person. [Acts 5:3-4] “He proceedeth from the Father and the Son, and with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified.” [John 14:26, John 15:26] The Scriptures ascribe to Him divine names, attributes, power, honor, and works. Christ commanded His disciples to baptize men in the name of the Father and of the Son <i>and of the Holy Ghost</i>. [Matt. 28:19]</p> <p>The Holy Spirit instructed the prophets and teachers of Old Testament times, [II Peter 1:21] and was poured out upon the apostles on the day of Pentecost. [Acts 2] He inspired the Holy Scriptures. [II Tim. 3:16] He comes into our hearts through the Word of God and the Sacraments.</p> <center>II. HIS WORK.</center> <p>The work of the Holy Ghost is <i>Sanctification</i>. This word is used here, at the head of the Third Article, in the wide sense, and includes the Holy Spirit's entire work upon our souls; namely, Calling, Enlightening, Sanctification in the narrower sense, and Preservation in the Faith.</p> <p>1. ITS NECESSITY. If the Holy Spirit does not work in us, we cannot be saved. Hence, we say in the catechism,</p> <center>I BELIEVE THAT I CANNOT BY MY OWN REASON OR STRENGTH BELIEVE IN JESUS</center> <center>2. ITS NATURE. BUT THE HOLY GHOST HAS</center> <p>CALLED ME THROUGH THE GOSPEL. [II Tim. 1:9] He has caused His Word to be written [II Thess. 2:14, II Tim. 3:16] and causes it to be continually proclaimed [John 20:31+, II Cor. 5:20, I Cor. 1:21] for the purpose of making God's grace known to me, and inviting me to share in it. He calls all men, and means His call earnestly. He does not merely seem to call some, but actually calls all who hear or read His Word. [I Tim. 2:4+, I Pet. 3:9] And along with the call, He gives us the strength which we need in order to believe. [Eph. 2:4-6] Those who obey the call are the Elect or Chosen [Matt. 20:16] ones, and obtain salvation. Those who refuse to obey the call are lost. [Mark 16:16] </p> <p>ENLIGHTENED ME BY HIS GIFTS. The Holy Ghost shows me my lost condition and God's saving mercy, and thus leads me to Repentance through the Law, [John 16:8, Rom. 3:20] and to Faith through the Gospel. [John 15:26, John 1:17]</p> <p><i>Repentance</i> includes</p> <p>1. An Acknowledgment and Confession of Sin. [Ps. 51:3, 4]</p> <p>2. Sincere Sorrow for Sin. [Luke 22:62] It must be sorrow for the sin itself, and not merely for the consequences of sin.</p> <p>3. The Hating and Forsaking of Sin. [Ps. 51:10]</p> <p>4. An Earnest Desire for Forgiveness. [Ps. 51:2, 9]</p> <p>True repentance always leads to faith. [II Cor. 7:10] Sorrow for sin which does not lead to faith, is not repentance but remorse, and often drives men to despair. [Matt. 27:3-5]</p> <p><i>Faith</i> includes</p> <p>1. A Knowledge of the Facts of the Gospel. [Rom. 10:14]</p> <p>2. A Belief of the Facts. [Rom. 4:20, 21]</p> <p>3. Trust or Confidence in Christ our Saviour. [II Tim. 1:12+] This trust is the chief part of faith.</p> <p>True faith is not a mere matter of the head, but of the heart. It is not a mere intellectual belief that God exists or that Christ lived and died; but it is a firm confidence that Christ is actually <i>our</i> Saviour, and that all <i>our</i> sins are washed away by His precious blood. Faith says, “The Son of God loved [I John 1:7] <i>me</i>, and gave Himself for me.” [Gal. 2:20]</p> <p>True faith is always preceded by repentance. The impenitent have no promise of forgiveness, and therefore cannot have faith. They cannot believe a promise which has not been given to them.</p> <p><i>Regeneration and Conversion.</i> Those whom the Holy Spirit has brought to repentance and faith are in a state of regeneration and conversion. The change which has taken place in them is called a new birth or regeneration, [John 3:5, 6] because a new life has been planted in them. [II Cor. 5:17+] It is called conversion, [Acts 3:19] because they have been converted or turned from sin to righteousness, from self to God.</p> <p>It is not necessary that a Christian should be able to point to the exact time of his conversion. The important question is not, “When were we converted?” but, “Are we now in a converted state?” that is, “Are we now penitent and believing?”</p> <p><i>Justification.</i> All those who have true faith are justified: [Rom. 5:1+, Rom. 4:5] their sins are forgiven, and the righteousness of Christ is imputed (counted as belonging) to them. [Phil. 3:9] When we believe in Christ, all that He has done and suffered for us is regarded by God as if we had done and suffered it ourselves; [II Cor. 5:21, Rom. 8:1+] for Christ was our substitute. Consequently, those who believe in Christ are <i>justified</i> for His sake; that is, they are pronounced by God to be righteous and fit to enter into heaven.</p> <p><i>By Faith Alone.</i> We are justified and saved by faith alone, without works. [Rom. 3:28+] We shall enter heaven, not because we deserve to enter, [Gal. 2:16+] but only because we believe in Christ. Salvation is a <i>Gift</i>: acquired for us by Christ's holy life and innocent death; bestowed upon us freely by God's grace; and accepted by faith. [Eph. 2:8, 9+] Our faith is not a merit on account of which we are forgiven, but it is the hand with which we reach out and accept the free gift of forgiveness which God offers for Christ's sake.</p> <p>Our own works have nothing to do with our justification. [Rom. 3:20+] If God took them into consideration at all, they would condemn us; for at best we are imperfect and sinful creatures. [Rom. 7:18-23, Gal. 3:10+] In order to be saved, we need a <i>perfect</i> righteousness, Christ's righteousness alone is perfect. It becomes ours by faith. </p> <p>AND SANCTIFIED. Those who have true faith are sanctified by the Holy Spirit; that is, they are made holy in heart and life. [Rom. 8:5+, Rom. 6:22] While good works do not save us, they do and must follow faith as its fruit. [Matt. 7:18] Believers do good works out of love to God and gratitude for His mercy. Faith that does not result in a holy life is a dead faith, [Jas. 2:26+] and cannot save. The Christian dare not live in sin. [Rom. 6:2+] He has become a new creature; for he is born again: and consequently he leads a new life. We shall, indeed, never become sinless in this world, but we must honestly and earnestly <i>try</i> to do God's will in all things. [Phil. 3:12-14, Matt. 5:16+] We should grow more and more holy every day. [Eph. 4:22-24, Rom. 12:2, I Thess. 4:1] We cannot do this by our own power, but we can by the help of God. We should, therefore, be diligent and faithful in the use of the Word of God and the Sacraments; for these are the means which the Holy Ghost uses for our sanctification.</p> <p>Faith in Christ does not at once make us perfectly holy and sinless, as some persons maintain; but it takes away the guilt of our sin. We are completely justified and forgiven as soon as we believe; but we are not completely sanctified. Sanctification is a gradual process, which will be completed only when we are transformed and glorified in heaven.</p> <p>PRESERVED ME IN THE TRUE FAITH. As it is the Holy Ghost who brings us to faith, so it is He who preserves us in it. [Phil. 1:6+] The world, the flesh, and the devil are enemies who seek to destroy our faith and to rob us of our salvation. We should constantly pray for strength to resist these enemies, [Matt. 26:41+, Rev. 2:10] and should obey the promptings of the Holy Spirit. We must avoid wilful, intentional sin, [Eph. 4:30+] and live a life of daily repentance. If we sin wilfully, we fall from grace and are lost, unless we come to true and lasting repentance. If we faithfully use the Means of Grace, and earnestly strive to lead a Christian life, the Holy Spirit will preserve us in the faith to the end. [Phil. 2:12, 13+]</p> <p>QUESTIONS.&mdash;1.

But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.</p> <p>John 20:31. But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name.</p> <p>I Tim. 2:4. Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.</p> <p>Matt. 20:16. So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many be called, but few chosen.</p> <p>II Tim. 1:12. For I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that He is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.</p> <p>II Cor. 5:17. Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.</p> <p>Rom. 5:1. Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.</p> <p>Rom. 8:1. There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus.</p> <p>Rom. 3:28. Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.</p> <p>Gal. 2:16. Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ.</p> <p>Eph. 2:8, 9. For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: not of works, lest any man should boast.</p> <p>Rom. 3:20. Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.</p> <p>Gal. 3:10. For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.</p> <p>Rom. 8:5. For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit, the things of the Spirit.</p> <p>Jas. 2:26. For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.</p> <p>Rom. 6:2. God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?</p> <p>Matt. 5:16. Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.</p> <p>Phil. 1:6. Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ.</p> <p>Matt. 26:41. Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. </p> <p>Eph. 4:30. And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.</p> <p>Phil. 2:12, 13.

                "content":"<center>III. HIS WORKMANSHIP.</center> <p>The Holy Christian Church, the Communion of Saints.</p> <hr> <p>WHAT THE CHURCH IS. The Church is “The Communion of Saints” or fellowship of believers. It consists of all those persons who truly believe in Christ. [Matt. 16:16, 18] We call it the <i>Workmanship</i> of the Holy Ghost, because He brings men to faith and thus produces the Church. HE CALLS, GATHERS, ENLIGHTENS AND SANCTIFIES THE WHOLE CHRISTIAN CHURCH ON EARTH, AND PRESERVES IT IN UNION WITH JESUS CHRIST IN THE TRUE FAITH. [Eph. 3:25-27] </p> <p>The Church may also be called the Holy Spirit's <i>Workshop</i>, because He abides and works in it through the Means of Grace,&mdash;the Word of God and the Sacraments.</p> <p>WHEN FOUNDED. The Holy Christian Church was founded on the day of Pentecost, when the Holy Ghost was poured out upon the disciples. [Acts 2:1-41] On that day the Gospel of the crucified and risen Saviour was first preached by the apostles, the first converts were made, and the first Christian baptisms were administered.</p> <p>VISIBLE OR INVISIBLE. The Church is invisible, because we cannot read men's hearts nor tell who are real believers. But if we regard the Church as an external organization which includes all who profess to believe, it is visible. In this outward visible Church there are many persons who are not real believers. But Christ knows His own. [II Tim 2:19+, John 10:14+] The angels on the day of judgment will separate the hypocrites from the true Christians. [Matt. 13:41, 42]</p> <p>THE MARKS OF THE CHURCH. The Church is found wherever the Gospel is rightly taught and the Sacraments are rightly administered. For wherever God's Word is preached, some persons believe it, [Isa. 55:10, 11] and where believers are, there is the Church.</p> <p>THE CHURCH IS ONE. It consists of the true believers out of all the different churches, denominations, and sects. There is one Flock, with one Shepherd. [John 10:16] The Church is the Body of which Christ is the Head. [Col. 1:18, Eph 1:22, 23]</p> <p>ITS NAMES. The Church is called <i>Holy</i>, because the Holy Spirit works in it and through it, and because its members, though not perfect, lead holy lives. It is called <i>Christian</i>, because it consists of those who believe in Christ. It is called <i>Catholic</i> or Universal, because it is meant to include all men everywhere. Catholic does not mean <i>Roman</i> Catholic. </p> <p>MILITANT AND TRIUMPHANT. The Church, consisting of true believers, is one and the same Church on earth and in heaven. On earth it is the Church Militant, because its members are still fighting the good fight of faith. [I Tim. 6:12+] In heaven it is the Church Triumphant, because its members have won the victory of faith. [Rev. 7:9-14, Rev. 2:18, Rev. 3:21] The only way into the Church Triumphant is through the Church Militant.</p> <center>THE CHURCH'S WORK.</center> <p>The Church is the agency or instrument which the Holy Spirit uses for the evangelization of the world. [Matt. 28:19, Mark 16:15] It is the institution through which He does His work of applying redemption to the souls of men. The Church, therefore, has a work to do: namely, to make disciples of all men.</p> <p>THE MEANS through which the Church, as an agency of the Holy Spirit, is to do its work are the Word of God and the Sacraments. They are sufficient for the purpose for which they are intended, because the Holy Spirit works through them and endows them with supernatural power. [Rom. 1:16, Heb. 4:12]</p> <p>THE WORKMEN who are to preach the Word and administer the Sacraments are the <i>ministers</i>. They must be properly called and ordained by the Church. [Act 14:23, Tit. 1:5] In the New Testament all pastors are called elders or bishops. It was only at a later period that the office of a bishop was made superior to that of elder, pastor or minister. The office of an apostle was a separate and higher office. The apostles were the witnesses of Christ's redemption, and possessed miraculous powers. They have no successors. Ministers are the ambassadors of Christ, beseeching men to be reconciled to God. [II Cor. 5:20+] Christ speaks through them. He who hears them, hears Christ; he who despises them, despises Christ. [Luke 10:16] If a minister should happen to be a hypocrite, his official acts, such as baptisms and the like, would still be valid. [II Tim. 2:13] <i>Deacons</i> [Acts 6:1-6] are officers whose duty it is to assist the pastor, and to look after the temporal interests of the congregation. <i>Deaconesses</i> [Rom.16:1] are consecrated to the work of love and mercy, and minister to the sick, the needy, the neglected, the ignorant, the fallen, and the friendless.</p> <center>THE VARIOUS CHURCHES.</center> <p>While the Church, in the strict sense of the word, is the “communion of saints” and therefore <i>one</i>, yet outwardly it has become divided, in the course of time, into many different churches, denominations, and sects. It contains Four Great Branches: <i>The Greek Catholic Church</i>; <i>The Roman Catholic Church</i>; <i>The Evangelical Lutheran Church</i>; and <i>The Reformed Churches</i>, comprising a great number of denominations and sects. The Lutheran Church and the Reformed Churches are called Protestant. (For the names and relations of various branches of the Church, see the accompanying Diagram, on page 106.)</p> <center>THE EVANGELICAL LUTHERAN CHURCH.</center> <p>The Evangelical Lutheran Church is in reality the old original Church which came into existence on the day of Pentecost. Luther simply threw out the errors which had crept into the Church during the course of the centuries, and held fast the doctrines taught in God's Word. As a separate and distinct Church, the Lutheran Church dates from the year 1530, when the Augsburg Confession was read before the emperor and diet of the German Empire. Her doctrines are laid down in her six Confessions, contained in the Book of Concord.</p> <p>Since a particular Church is no older than her distinctive confession, the Lutheran Church is more than thirty years older than the Roman Catholic Church; for the Augsburg Confession was adopted in 1530, while the Canons and Decrees of the Council of Trent, which are the Confession of the Roman Catholic Church, were not completed until 1563. The ecumenical creeds are accepted by both Churches, and therefore prove nothing as regards their <i>relative</i> age.</p> <p>THE CHURCH OF THE PURE GOSPEL. The Lutheran Church receives the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments as the only rule and standard of religious teaching. The Roman Catholic Church accepts the tradition of the Church as of equal authority with the Holy Scriptures.</p> <p>The Lutheran Church teaches the great central doctrine of the Gospel, that we are saved by <i>faith alone</i> without works. The Roman Catholic Church teaches that we are justified by faith <i>and works</i>.</p> <p>The Lutheran Church abides by the teachings of Scripture even when she cannot understand them. The other Protestant Churches explain away and reject some teachings of Scripture because they cannot understand them.</p> <p>HER NAME. The name Lutheran was first given to our Church by her enemies. But she accepted it, because she believes the doctrines which Luther taught. The name which she chose for herself is Evangelical (true to the Gospel). She is now known by both names taken together, Evangelical Lutheran.</p> <p>WHERE FOUND. The Lutheran Church is found in nearly all parts of the world, especially in Germany, Scandinavia, and the United States. In 1905 she numbered over 73 million baptized members, or practically as many as all the other Protestant Churches taken together. In the United States she has almost two million confirmed members (statistics for 1906), and ranks third in size among the Protestant Churches of the country.</p> <p>IN AMERICA. The Lutheran Church in North America comprises the following general bodies: The General Synod, organized in 1821; the General Council, organized in 1867; the Synodical Conference, organized in 1872; the United Synod South, organized in 1886. To these general bodies there belong various synods. There are also a number of Independent Synods which are not connected with any general body. Synods are often subdivided into Conferences.</p> <p>HER WORK. The Lutheran Church, like the Church in general, is to make disciples (Christians) of men. She is all the more bound to do her work, because she is the Church of the Pure Gospel. Her work is done in local congregations, in Home Missions, Foreign Missions, Inner Missions, and in maintaining the necessary institutions of learning (colleges, seminaries, etc.) and of mercy (orphanages, asylums, hospitals).</p> <p>DUTIES OF HER MEMBERS. It is the duty of her members to lead a Christian life, to be loyal to their own Church, and to co-operate heartily in all her local and general work, for the glory of God and the salvation of immortal souls.</p> <p>QUESTIONS.&mdash;1.

                "content":"<p>The Lord's Prayer is so-called because it was given to us by the Lord Jesus Christ. [Matt. 6:9-13, Luke 11:1-4] It teaches us how to pray aright, and is the model after which we should fashion all our prayers. It shows us the manner in which we should come to God, and the things for which we should ask.</p> <p>ITS CONTENTS. The Lord's Prayer contains an Introduction, Seven Petitions, and a Conclusion. The first three petitions regard God's glory, and deal with His Name, His Kingdom, and His Will; the last four regard our bodily and spiritual needs, and deal with our Daily Bread, Forgiveness, Temptation, and Deliverance from Evil. Six petitions, the first three and the last three, refer to spiritual gifts; and only one, the fourth, refers to earthly gifts. Thus we are taught that, when we pray, we should think first of God's glory; and that we should pray more for spiritual than for temporal benefits.</p> <p>INTRODUCTION.</p> <p>Our Father Who art in Heaven.</p> <p><i>What is meant by this Introduction?</i></p> <p>God would thereby affectionately encourage us to believe that He is truly our Father, and that we are His children indeed, so that we may call upon Him with all cheerfulness and confidence, even as beloved children entreat their affectionate parent.</p> <hr> <p>This Introduction shows us the manner in which we should come to God in prayer; namely, as His children, who are asking their Father for what they need, and who are sure that He loves them and will answer their prayer.</p> <p>OUR FATHER. God is our Father and we are His children through Christ our Saviour. [Gal 3:26+, 1 John 3:1, 2, Rom. 8:16] We should therefore be sure that He will receive us kindly for Jesus' sake whenever we come before him with our prayers. We should CALL UPON HIM WITH ALL CHEERFULNESS AND CONFIDENCE, EVEN AS BELOVED CHILDREN ENTREAT THEIR AFFECTIONATE PARENT. [Matt. 7:11+, Rom. 8:15+, Heb. 4:16]</p> <p></p> <p>We are taught to say <i>our</i> and not <i>my</i> Father, because the Lord's Prayer was given to believers to use in their common worship as well as in their private devotions; and because we should pray not only for ourselves but for our fellow-believers and for all men.</p> <p>WHO ART IN HEAVEN. An earthly father is not always able to do what his children ask, even if he desires to do so. But the Father to whom we here pray is our Heavenly Father, and is abundantly able to answer all our prayers, [Eph. 3:20+] He not only loves us with an everlasting love, but is almighty, omniscient, and all-wise. He is able to do all things which He wills to do, and will answer all our prayers in the very way that is best for us.</p> <p>QUESTIONS.&mdash;1. Why is the Lord's Prayer so called? 2. What does it teach us? 3. What does it contain? 4. What can you say about the seven petitions? 5. What does the introduction show? 6. Why do we say Our <i>Father</i>? 7. How should this encourage us to call upon Him? 8. Why do we say <i>Our</i> Father? 9.

This petition does not imply, therefore, that we are to <i>make</i> God's name holy.</p> <p>BUT WE PRAY IN THIS PETITION THAT IT MAY BE HALLOWED ALSO BY US.

[John 17:17+] But the Word must be taught in its truth and purity; that is, it must be taught as it is recorded in the Scriptures, with nothing added, taken away, or changed. [Gal. 1:9, Rev 22:18, 19]</p> <p>AND WE AS THE CHILDREN OF GOD LEAD HOLY LIVES IN ACCORDANCE WITH IT. In order to hallow God's name, we must not only hear but obey His Word.

                "content":"<p>In this Petition we acknowledge our sinfulness, pray for forgiveness, and promise to forgive our fellow-men.</p> <p>The word “And” connects this petition very closely with the preceding one. The daily forgiveness of our sins is as necessary for our souls as our daily bread is for our bodies.</p> <center>AND FORGIVE US OUR TRESPASSES.</center> <p>These words are at once a Confession of Sin, and a Prayer for Pardon.</p> <p>1. <i>A Confession.</i> The praying of this petition presupposes a penitent state of heart. If we are not truly penitent, this petition is a mockery on our lips. We have need to confess our guilt, because</p> <p>WE DAILY COMMIT MUCH SIN. [I John 4:8] If we are true Christians, we do not sin wilfully and intentionally. But with our best efforts, we still sin much through weakness, [Rom. 7:19] not only by commission, but still more by omission. Not a day passes by, in which we do not transgress God's law by thoughts and words and deeds. We often do the wrong and omit doing the right without even knowing that we have done so. [Ps. 19:12]</p> <p>AND DESERVE CHASTISEMENT (Punishment) ALONE. Our sins make us guilty and deserving of punishment, even though they be sins of weakness. We must not excuse or extenuate them. God never excuses any one. But if we penitently confess our sins, He will forgive us for Jesus' sake. [Ps. 32:5+, I John 1:9]</p> <p>2. <i>A Prayer for Pardon.</i> As in the fourth petition we daily pray “Give,” so in this fifth petition we daily pray “Forgive.” Since Jesus has taught us to pray thus, and we pray as God's children, this petition presupposes that we pray in faith. We pray as those who believe that God will be gracious and merciful to us for Jesus' sake.</p> <center>WE PRAY IN THIS PETITION THAT OUR HEAVENLY FATHER WOULD NOT REGARD OUR</center> <p>NOR DENY US OUR REQUESTS ON ACCOUNT OF THEM. If God should regard our sins, He would send only punishment upon us, [Ps. 130:3+, Ps.143:2] and not give us any of those benefits for which we ask in our prayer.</p> <center>FOR WE ARE NOT WORTHY OF ANYTHING FOR WHICH WE PRAY, HAVE NOT MERITED</center> <center>AS WE FORGIVE THOSE WHO TRESPASS AGAINST US.</center> <p>3. <i>A Promise to Forgive our Fellow-men.</i> God's mercy to us must move as to be merciful to others. [Eph. 3:32] If it does not, God will withdraw His mercy from us, [Matt. 6:14, 15+] as the master withdrew his from the unmerciful servant in the parable. [Matt. 18:32-35] Forgiving others is not a merit which entitles us to receive God's forgiveness. It follows as a result of God's mercy to us. Because God so mercifully forgives us for Jesus' sake, we promise that</p> <center>WE WILL, THEREFORE, ON OUR PART, BOTH HEARTILY FORGIVE AND ALSO READILY</center> <p>QUESTIONS.&mdash;1. What three things do we do in this petition? 2. What is to be said about the close connection between this petition and the preceding one? 3. What does this petition presuppose? 4. Why do we need to confess our guilt to God? 5. Is sin ever excusable? 6. Why does this petition presuppose faith? 7. What do we pray God to do with our sins? 8. If God regarded our sins, how would He treat our requests? 9. Why do we promise to forgive others? 10. Why must we be willing to forgive them?</p> <p>SCRIPTURE VERSES.&mdash;Ps. 32:5. I acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin.</p> <p>Ps. 130:3. If thou, LORD, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?</p> <p>Luke 15:18, 19. I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.</p> <p>Matt. 6:14, 15. For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you: but if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.</p> <p>READING.-The Unmerciful Servant, Matt. 18:23-35.</p>"

But this petition comes last, because we should be more anxious to be delivered from the sin itself, than from the evil results which follow upon it.</p> <p>There is a very close connection between the last two petitions, marked by the word “But.” “Temptation will not cease until deliverance from evil [and from the evil one] has come; and again, when deliverance from evil has come, temptation will cease to assail us.”&mdash;Luekrs.</p> <p>WE PRAY IN PETITION AS IN A SUMMARY.

God wills that we should sometimes suffer affliction, in order that our repentance and faith may be increased. [Isa. 48:10+, Rev. 3:19+, II Cor. 4:17, 18] Consequently, our prayer for deliverance from evil in this world is a prayer: 1. That, whenever it is possible according to His will, God would ward off affliction from us. 2. That He would give us grace to bear patiently those afflictions which He sends, [II Cor. 12:9+, Rom 8:28] and would make them a blessing in disguise for us. 3. That in His own time He would remove from us whatever distresses us. [I Sam. 2:6, 7]</p> <p>We should not grow discouraged or despondent under affliction, but trust in God's mercy and bear our cross cheerfully. [Matt. 10:38] And we should see to it that we do not, by our own sin and folly, bring upon ourselves evils which might have been avoided.</p> <center>II. IN THE NEXT WORLD.</center> <p>In this world we shall have to endure some evils as long as we live. [John 16:33] But if we are faithful, God will not only overrule them all for our good, [Gen. 50:20] but will finally, at death, deliver us from all evil.
