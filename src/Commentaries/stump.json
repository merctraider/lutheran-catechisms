                "content":"<p><strong>The Ten Commandments</strong> are called the <i>Moral Law</i>, or more briefly the Law, and sometimes the Decalogue or the Ten Words. They make known to us God's will, which is the law for all His creatures. Each commandment has a <i>negative</i> side, and <i>forbids</i> something; each has also a <i>positive</i> side, and <i>commands</i> or enjoins something.</p> <p><strong>The Giving Of The Law.</strong> The Law of God was originally written in man's heart at creation. [Rom. 2:15] We call that law in the heart, Conscience. After the fall into sin, the conscience became darkened, and men did not always know right from wrong, and fell into gross idolatry. [Rom. 1:21-23] God, therefore, through Moses at Mount Sinai, gave men His law anew, [Exod. 20:1] written on two Tables of stone. [Exod. 31:18] He also gave the Israelites national and ceremonial laws. These, being meant for a particular people and a certain era of the world, are no longer binding upon us. But the Moral Law has been expressly confirmed by our Lord Jesus Christ as valid for all time and binding upon all men. [Matt. 22:37-40+]</p> <p><strong>The substance of the law</strong> is, “Thou shalt love the Lord Thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind.” and “Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.”</p> <p><strong>The purpose of the law</strong> is, 1. To put a check upon wicked men, [I Tim. 1:9] 2. To convince us of our sinfulness [Rom. 3:20+] and our need of the Saviour, [Gal. 3:24+] and 3. To be our rule and guide for Christian conduct. [John. 14:15+, Matt. 7:12+] It is especially with respect to the second purpose here mentioned, that the Ten Commandments were assigned by Luther to the first and not to a later place in his catechism.</p> <p><strong>The Two Tables.</strong> The Ten Commandments may be divided into two parts, called the Two Tables of the Law. [Exod. 31:18] The First Table includes the first three commandments, and teaches us our Duty to God. The Second Table Includes the last seven commandments, and teaches us our Duty to our Fellow-men.</p> <p>The Ten Commandments are not numbered in the Bible. A two-fold numbering is found among Christians. The first is that which is given in our Catechism, and which is accepted by the majority of Christians, The other numbering makes two commandments of our first (the second being the command not to make any images), and joins our ninth and tenth into one. This makes a difference in the numbering of all the commandments except the first.</p> <p><strong>Questions.—</strong> 1. What other names are given to the Tea Commandments? 2. What do they make known to us? 3. What two sides are there to each commandment? 4. Where was the law of God originally written? 5. Why and when was the Law given anew? 6. Why is the Moral Law binding upon us, while the national and ceremonial laws of Israel are not? 7. What is the substance of the Law? 8. What is the threefold purpose of the Law? 9. Into how many Tables is the Law divided, and what does each Table teach? 10. How many commandments does each Table include?</p> <p><strong>SCRIPTURE VERSES.—</strong>Matt. 22:37-40. Jesus said unto him, Thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.</p> <p>Rom. 3:20. Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.</p> <p>Gal. 3:24. Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.</p> <p>John 14:15. If ye love me, keep my commandments.</p> <p>Matt. 7:12. Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.</p> <p><strong>Reading.—</strong>The Giving of the Law at Mt. Sinai, Exod. 19 and 20.</p>"

                "content":"<p>I am the Lord thy God.</p> <p><strong>These introductory words</strong> show who is the Lawgiver. [Jas. 4:12] As earthly kings place their names at the beginning of their decrees to give them authority, so God places His name at the beginning of the commandments in order to make known who gives them, and whose displeasure we shall incur if we disobey them. These introductory words belong not only to the first but to all the commandments.</p> <p><strong>I AM.</strong> By these words God reminds us that He is a Person. He speaks to us. He is not an impersonal God who pervades and is a part of nature. He is above nature and has created it. [Gen 1:1]</p> <p><strong>THE LORD.</strong> The word here translated “Lord” means in the original Hebrew “I AM THAT I AM.” [Exod 8:14+] God thereby declares that He is the One and Only Self-existent, [Isa 44:6+] Eternal, [Ps 90:1, 2+] and Unchangeable Being. [Mal 3:6+] He is the true and living God in contradistinction from all so-called gods. [Jer 10:10] The name Jehovah or “LORD” is used in the Old Testament Scriptures to designate God as the covenant God of Israel. It signified that He stood in a specially near relation to them as His chosen people. The name has the same comforting meaning for Christians; for they are the New Testament people of God. [Tit 2:14+, I Pet 2-9]</p> <p><strong>THY GOD.</strong> These words express God’s good-will toward us. He is our God who loves [Jer 31:3+] us and cares for us. [I Pet 5:7] He said to Israel, “I am the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.” He has delivered us from the still greater bondage of sin, death, and the devil through His Son Jesus Christ, [Col 1:13+] and has a right to expect our gratitude and love.</p> <p><strong>THE LORD THY GOD.</strong> He who gives us these commandments is a Spirit [John 4:24+] of infinite majesty and goodness. He is:</p> <ol> <li><i>Eternal</i>; He always was and always will be. [Ps 90:2]</li> <li><i>Unchangeable</i>; He always was and always will be the same. [Mal 3:6]</li> <li><i>Omnipresent</i>; He is present everywhere at the same time and all the time. [Ps 139:7-11]</li> <li>4. <i>Omniscient</i>; He knows all the past, present, and future, and is acquainted with every thought, desire, and purpose of our hearts. [Ps 139:2]</li> <li>5. <i>Omnipotent</i>, or Almighty; He is able to do all things which He wills to do. [Luke 1:37]</li> <li>6. <i>Holy</i>; He is perfectly pure, and separate from all that is evil. [Isa. 6:3]</li> <li>7. <i>Just</i>; He will bless those who keep His law, and punish those who break it. [Rom. 2:6]</li> <li>8. <i>All-wise</i>; He always knows what is the best thing to do, and the best way to do it. [Col. 2:3]</li> <li>9. <i>Good</i>; He is Love itself. [I John 4:8] He is kind even to the unthankful, [Matt. 5:45] merciful to the penitent soul for Jesus' sake, [John 3:16] and longsuffering toward the impenitent in order to lead them to repentance by His goodness. [II Pet. 3:9, Rom. 2:4]</li> <li>10. <i>Faithful and True</i>; He can be absolutely relied upon to do all that He has promised or threatened. [Numb. 23:19]</li> </ol> <p>Because of the Majesty and Goodness of the Lord our God, we should FEAR and LOVE HIM, and KEEP His commandments.</p> <p><strong>QUESTIONS—</strong>1. What do the introductory words show? 2. Of what do the words “I am” remind us? 3. What is the meaning of the Hebrew word translated “Lord”? 4. What do the words “thy God” express? 5. From what bondage has God delivered us? 6. Name and define God’s attributes? 7. Why should we fear and love God?</p> <p><strong>SCRIPTURE VERSES.—</strong>Exod. 3:14. And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM.</p> <p>Isa. 44:6. Thus saith the LORD the King of Israel, and his Redeemer the LORD of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no God.</p> <p>Ps. 90:1, 2. LORD, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations. Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God.</p> <p>Mal. 3:6. For I am the LORD. I change not.</p> <p>Tit. 2:14. Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</p> <p>Jer. 31:3. I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn thee.</p> <p>Col. 1:13, 14. Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son: in whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins.</p> <p>John 4:24.

God being a Spirit, the making of an image of God would at that period necessarily have resulted in idolatry. But since Christ has come in the flesh and was visible among men, we are permitted to make pictures and images of Him. Luther preached very forcibly against those persons who, during his absence from Wittenberg, destroyed the pictures and images in the churches. He said that we make a picture of Christ in our heart whenever we think of Him, and put pictures of Him in the Bible and other books; and that therefore it is not wrong to place pictures or images of Him in our churches, so long as we do not worship them.</p> <p><p><i>Secret Idolatry</i> is committed by all who put (a) Self, [Prov. 3:6, 6.+, Jer. 9:23, 24] (b) Fellow-men [Acts 5:29+, Matt. 10:28+, Matt. 10:37+, Ps. 146:3-5] or (c) Objects of this world [I John 2:15-17+] (money, fame, business, pleasure, etc.) above God, by fearing, loving, or trusting in them more than in God.</p></p> </li> <li> <p><p><strong>Godlessness. </strong>[Sam. 2:30, Ps. 10:4] Neglect to worship the true God, unbelief, scepticism, superstition, Infidelity, and atheism are a transgression of this commandment.</p></p> </li> <li><p><strong>Double service.</strong> [Matt. 6:24+] God forbids us to have other gods before or besides Him, He demands our whole heart.</p></li> </ol>"

[Gen. 39:9+, Ps. 33:8, 9.] Rather than disobey Him, we should be willing to suffer ridicule, persecution, loss of money, property, position, or friends, and even death itself. [Matt. 10:28+, Acts 5:29]</p> <p><i>Why</i>. We should fear God above all things, 1. Because He is omniscient, and we cannot hide anything from Him, not even our thoughts. [Ps. 139:1, 2+] 2. Because He is holy, and hates everything that is evil. [Lev. 19:2] 3. Because He is just, and will punish every sin. [Ps. 5:4]</p> <p><i>How</i>. As Christians, our fear of God should be a child-like and not a slavish fear. Child-like fear is fear mingled with love. We should refrain from evil not simply from fear of punishment, but from fear of offending the God whom we love. [Rom. 8:15+] “Slavish fear Is afraid God will come; child-like fear is afraid He will go away.”</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>WE SHOULD LOVE GOD ABOVE ALL THINGS</strong>, “with all our heart, and with all our mind and with all our soul.” [Matt. 22:37] Our first aim and our highest delight should always be to do God’s will.

We should love God above all things 1. Because He is most worthy of our love. [Ps. 73:25, 26+] 2. Because He first loved us, [I John 4:19+, I John 4:9+] and gave His Son to die for us. 3. Because our highest happiness is found in loving Him.</p> <p><i>How we should show our Love</i>. We should show that we love God above all things 1. By leading a godly life. [II John 6] 2. By loving the things of God, especially the Church and the Gospel. [John 8:47] 3. By loving our fellow-men for His sake. [I John 4:20+]</p> </li> <li><p><strong>WE SHOULD TRUST IN GOD ABOVE ALL THINGS.</strong> We should rely with all our heart upon His love and care, [Prov. 3:5+] placing our chief dependence on Him, and not on our own wisdom, skill, or strength, or upon men, money etc.</p> <p><i>Why</i>. We should trust in God with all our heart because 1. He loves us. [Rom. 8:32] 2. He knows all our wants. [Matt. 6:32] 3. He knows what is best for us. 4. He is able to do all things. 5. He has promised to care for us. [Heb. 13:5, Isa. 54:10, Isa. 41:10]</p> <p><i>How we should show our Trust</i>. If we trust in God above all things we will show that trust, 1. By freedom from unbelieving care and worry. [Matt. 6:25, I Pet. 5:7+] 2. By reliance upon God's help and protection at all times. [Ps. 33:18, 19] 3.

We dare not shorten another person's life, nor our own. God gives life, and He alone has the right to take it away.</p> <p>This commandment <i>forbids</i> us to kill or injure other persons or ourselves. It <i>commands</i> us to assist and comfort our neighbor in danger and want.</p> <p>I. WHAT is FORBIDDEN.</p> <p>We must not</p> <center>1. KILL OR INJURE OTHER PERSONS.</center> <p><i>Murder</i>. To destroy any human life, even if it be very young or yet unborn, is a great crime. He who commits murder is to be punished with death. [Gen. 9:6+] Among the motives which prompt to murder are anger, hatred, [Gen. 4:1-8] envy, [Gen. 37] jealousy, revenge, [Matt. 14:3-11, Rom. 12:19+] frivolity, avarice, robbery, and a desire to hide past sin. [II Sam. 11] We must be on our guard against all that would ever tempt us to this great crime.</p> <p><i>Duels</i>. It is foolish as well as sinful to pretend to establish the right or wrong of a question by a duel.</p> <p><i>Unjust Wars</i> are wholesale murder. Rulers must do all that they honorably can to prevent war. Yet as a last resort to maintain the right, war is justifiable.</p> <p><i>Hatred</i> is murder in the heart. “He that hateth his brother is a murderer.” [I John 3:15, Matt. 5:21, 22+, Eph. 4:31, 32+]</p> <p><i>Tempting Others</i> to useless risks in which they may perish or be injured, or to drunkenness, dissipation, etc. which will shorten their life, is a transgression of this commandment.</p> <p><i>Causing Accidents</i> by neglect, carelessness or bad workmanship, or</p> <p><i>Shortening Other People's Lives</i> [Gen. 37:31-35] by maltreatment, overwork, worriment, etc. makes men guilty of sin against this commandment.</p> <p><i>Neglect to Warn</i> others of impending danger <i>or neglect to assist</i> them in need may result in their injury or death.</p> <p>The law recognizes our right to defend our life when it is unjustly assailed. But killing others in self-defense must he our last resort. Many persons act hastily. The official who inflicts the death penalty on condemned criminals is not guilty of wrong, but is doing his duty as an officer of the State. [Rom 13:4]</p> <p>It is a sin to kill our neighbor's <i>soul</i> by tempting him to sin, or enticing him to wrong-doing by our evil example.</p> <p>We must not</p> <p>2.&mdash;KILL OR INJURE OURSELVES.</p> <p>Suicide is often prompted by despair, remorse, [Matt. 27:35] cowardice, recklessness, or insanity. But it is sinful as well as foolish and cowardly. He who commits it robs himself of the opportunity to repent, and leaves others to bear the burdens from which he shrank. If we are tempted to despair, we should not commit suicide, but seek comfort and strength in God's Word. If we have fallen into disgrace by sin, we should repent and lead a better life.</p> <p><i>Duels</i>. We not only have no right to endanger another's life by a duel, but we have no right to endanger our own. The duel, which was once a common practice, has justly fallen under the condemnation of public opinion.</p> <p><i>A Life of Sin</i>. Impurity, drunkenness, gluttony, or dissipation will shorten our life, and make us die before our allotted time.</p> <p><i>Disregard of the Laws of Health</i>, overwork, needless exposure, carelessness, violent anger, needless worry, are all forbidden by this commandment.</p> <p>The voluntary sacrifice of our life for truth and right (martyrdom), or in defense of our country, or in an effort to rescue and save others, is not only justifiable but noble.

                "content":"<p>This commandment is meant to preserve our personal purity, and to guard the holy estate of marriage. It <i>forbids</i> adultery and all impurity. It <i>commands</i> chastity and purity in thought, word, and deed.</p> <center>I. PURITY.</center> <p>We should be CHASTE AND PURE</p> <p><i>In Heart.</i> We should keep our heart free from impure thoughts and desires. [Matt. 5:8+, Prov. 4:23+, Ps. 51:10] God judges us by the state of our heart. [I Sam. 16:7] Unchaste thoughts must not be delighted in nor harbored, but subdued and stamped out. They poison the soul. They are themselves a transgression of this commandment, [Matt. 5:28+] and they lead to further transgressions of it by word and deed.</p> <p>IN WORDS. We must avoid immodest conversation, unchaste words, vile stories, and shameless jests. [Eph. 5:3-4, Eph. 4:29+] Such things are not smart, as many think, but vile and despicable. We should never take part in nor listen to a conversation which we would be ashamed to have overheard by persons whom we respect.</p> <p>IN DEEDS. We should carefully avoid every act which would bring the blush of shame to our cheeks if it were known to our parents or others whose opinion we cherish. Our bodies are to be God's temple, [I Cor. 6:19, 20+] and they dare not be given over to sin and impurity. [Rom. 6:13] We should remember that God sees even in secret, and knows all our actions. [Ps. 139:1-12]</p> <p><i>Impurity</i> of heart and life will not go unpunished. [I Cor. 3:16, 17+, Gal. 5:19-21+] It is often followed by the most dreadful consequences: a ruined body, an enfeebled mind, a poisoned soul, a tortured conscience, public shame, dreadful disease and an untimely death.</p> <p><i>To Keep ourselves Pure</i> we should watch and pray, [Matt. 26:41+] avoid idleness, evil company, bad books and papers, indecent songs and pictures, immoral plays, intemperance in eating and drinking, and all that would incite to impurity. We should keep our minds occupied with good thoughts and desires, so that we have no room for evil ones. [Rom. 13:14]</p> <center>II. MARRIAGE.</center> <p>Marriage is the union of one man and one woman for life in the bonds of love and faithfulness.</p> <p><i>A Holy Estate</i>. Marriage was instituted by God in Eden [Gen. 2:13] and was sanctioned by Christ, who performed His first miracle at a wedding. [John 2:1-11] It is a holy estate. Celibacy is not a holier estate than marriage, as the Roman Catholic Church maintains. [I Tim. 4:1-3]</p> <p><i>Indissoluble</i>. The marriage tie is binding until one of the married persons dies. [Matt. 19:6+] Except by death, the marriage relation cannot be broken or dissolved without sin against this sixth commandment. [Matt. 5:32+, Matt 19:9] If one party to the marriage is guilty of adultery, the innocent party may obtain a divorce. No other divorces are allowed by Christ.</p> <p><i>An Important Step</i>. Marriage is a most important step in life. It must not be entered into hastily or thoughtlessly. If a mistake is made in the choice of a partner for life, the mistake can never be remedied. Those who contemplate such a step should pray for God's guidance. Marriage should not be entered upon for money, social advantages, and the like, but for love. Parents should be consulted. While marriage by a civil magistrate is valid, Christians should seek God's blessing upon their union and be married by His ordained servant. The laws of the State must be carefully obeyed. Marriage between near relatives is forbidden by God's Word. [Lev. 18] Those who are married should, if possible, be of the same faith. Marriages between Protestants and Roman Catholics are seldom happy.</p> <p><i>Duty of Husband</i> [Eph. 5:25+, Col. 3:19] <i>and Wife.</i> [Eph. 5:22+, Col. 3:18] EACH SHOULD LOVE AND HONOR HIS WIFE OR HER HUSBAND. The man is the head of the family, but he must not be a tyrant. The wife is not his slave, but his dearest companion. They are no longer two but one, with a common love, a common life, a common property, common children, common hopes and aspirations, and a common Saviour. [I Pet. 3:7, I Pet. 3:1] They should be patient with one another's faults, just to one another's virtues, and should unselfishly seek one another's happiness. They should live together in mutual love and faithfulness till separated by death. Only when husband and wife continue to love and honor one another can they be happy. The breaking of the marriage covenant is followed by shame and misery.</p> <p>QUESTIONS.&mdash;1. What is this commandment meant to preserve and guard? 2. What does it forbid and command? 3.

Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy: for the temple of God is holy; which temple ye are.</p> <p>Gal. 5:19-21.

                "content":"<p>The object of this commandment is to protect every man in the possession of that which is lawfully his own. Without such protection the individual could not support his life, and society could not exist. The industrious and thrifty would be at the mercy of the lazy and wicked. This commandment <i>forbids</i> us to use dishonest means of acquiring property. It <i>commands</i> us to assist our neighbor to improve and protect his own.</p> <p>PROPERTY consists of whatever each person lawfully acquires of the earth's lands, forests, water, mines, houses, goods or money. It may be rightfully acquired by original claim, inheritance, gift, or labor of body or mind. Honest labor united with economy is the best way to acquire it.</p> <p>UNEQUAL DIVISION. God, who is the absolute owner of all things, [I Cor. 10:26] divides to each as He will. [Jer. 27:5] He “maketh poor and maketh rich.” [I Sam. 2:7, Prov. 22:2+] Much poverty, however, is due to men’s own laziness, idleness, [II Thess. 3:10+] carelessness or extravagance; and much wealth has been wrongfully gained contrary to God’s will as expressed in this commandment. <i>Communism</i>, or the equal division of property among all men, is not practicable. It failed in the apostolic Church. [Acts 5:1-10] If all things were equally divided, some would soon clamor for another division.</p> <p>POVERTY AND RICHES. The happiest person is he who is neither rich nor poor, but has sufficient for his needs. [Prov. 30:7-9+, Prov. 15:16-17+] Poverty may tempt a man to dishonesty; and riches may lead him to avarice, hardness of heart, worldliness and extravagance. [I Tim. 6:9, 10, I Tim. 6:17+] Riches make it hard for a man to enter into the kingdom of God. [Matt. 19:24+, Matt. 13:22] We should respect men for what they are, and not for what they have. We should not flatter the rich nor despise the poor. [Jas. 2:1-4]</p> <p>USE OF PROPERTY. God entrusts earthly property to us as His stewards. [Luke 19:12-27, Matt. 25:14-30, Luke 16:1-8] Whether we are rich or poor, we should so use our property as to be able to give an account to God. <i>For ourselves</i> and those dependent on us [I Tim. 5:8+] we should use it for the supply of our bodily needs (food, clothing, shelter, a reasonable amount of pleasure) and of our spiritual needs [Luke 12:15+, Matt. 6:33, I Cor. 9:14] (the Church and the Gospel). <i>For our fellow-men</i> we should, when necessary, use it according to our ability for their bodily needs (the poor) and their spiritual needs (Home and Foreign Missions). [Matt. 22:39]</p> <center>I. WHAT IS FORBIDDEN.</center> <p>1. ROBBING OUR NEIGHBOR. The grossest forms of dishonesty are Robbery, Theft, Burglary, Embezzlement, and Forgery. These are recognized by all as wrong. But it is also wrong to bring our neighbor's property into our possession, by</p> <p>2. UNFAIR DEALING AND FRAUDULENT MEANS, [Prov. 29:24, Lev. 6:2, 3, Ps. 37:21, Jer. 22:13, Lev. 19:35, 36, Hab. 2:6, Prov. 15:6, Deut. 24:14, Jas. 5:4, Prov. 11:1] such as Concealing stolen property, Withholding lost or borrowed property, Evading taxes, Refusing to pay debts, Wilful idleness and beggary, Betting and gambling, Lotteries and chancing, Bribery, Useless lawsuits, Negligent management of another's property, Stealing car-rides, Unfaithful labor, Insufficient wages, Cornering the market, Overcharging, Usury, Adulterating goods, Giving short weight or measure, and Cheating of any kind.</p> <p>3. <i>Dishonesty in the Heart</i>. Dishonesty has its source in the covetousness and greed of the human heart. [Mic. 2:2] Men first covet, and then steal or defraud. We must beware of covetousness. [Luke 12:15+] The love of money is a root of all evil. [I Tim. 6:10+] We must be honest even in small matters. He who is dishonest in little will be dishonest in much. [Luke 16:10] We must avoid all that would tempt us to dishonesty; namely, evil companions, idleness, speculation, extravagance, etc.</p> <center>II. WHAT IS COMMANDED.</center> <p>We should</p> <p>1. ASSIST OUR NEIGHBOR TO IMPROVE AND PROTECT HIS PROPERTY. [Exod. 23:4, 5, Matt. 7:12] We should help him to get along well in the world, and do what we can to prevent him from being deprived of his possessions.</p> <p>2. <i>Restore to the real owner</i> whatever has been dishonestly gotten. [Luke 19:8]</p> <p>3. <i>Be Ready to use our money</i> and property in order to help and benefit our neighbor. [Eph. 4:28+, Heb. 13.18+, I Pet. 4:10] We must be helpful and charitable toward our fellow-men.</p> <p>QUESTIONS.&mdash;1. What is the object of the seventh commandment? 2.

The rich and poor meet together: the LORD is the maker of them all.</p> <p>II Thess. 3:10. This we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat.</p> <p>Prov. 30:7-9. Two things have I required of thee; deny me them not before I die: Remove far from me vanity and lies; give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me: lest I be full, and deny thee, and say, Who is the LORD? or lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God in vain.</p> <p>Prov. 15:16-17. Better is little with the fear of the LORD, than great treasure and trouble therewith. Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a stalled ox and hatred therewith.</p> <p>I Tim. 6:17. Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy.</p> <p>Matt. 19:24. And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</p> <p>I Tim. 5:8. But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.</p> <p>Luke 12:15. And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.</p> <p>I Tim. 6:10. For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.</p> <p>Eph. 4:28. Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth.</p> <p>Heb. 13:16.

                "content":"<p>A JEALOUS GOD. God claims our highest love, and is grieved and offended if we turn our affections away from Him and disobey His law. He will punish or bless men according as they hate or love Him: [Rom. 2:6-10, Deut. 11:26-28, Gal. 6:7-8] “to the third and fourth generation of them that hate him,” and “unto thousands of them that love Him and keep His commandments.”</p> <center>I. PUNISHMENT.</center> <center>GOD THREATENS TO PUNISH</center> <p>1. <i>Whom?</i> ALL THOSE WHO TRANSGRESS THESE COMMANDMENTS [Rom: 1:18+, Lev 26:14-15, Isa 59:2, Ezek. 18:4+, Rom. 6:23+] by commission, (doing what is forbidden) or omission (not doing what is commanded), whether it be transgression by deed or word or thought. Every transgression, great or small, is sin, and makes men guilty and punishable. [Gal. 3:10]</p> <p>2. <i>Why?</i> Because justice demands it. [Gal. 6:7+] God cannot be unjust. He cannot overlook or excuse sin. [Eccl. 11:9] Earthly governments must and do punish offenders, or they would be unjust to those persons who obey the law. A law without a penalty would amount to nothing. God, who governs the universe, is and must be just. [Gen. 18:25+]</p> <p>3. <i>How?</i></p> <p><i>In this World</i> God punishes sin by Pangs of Conscience; [Matt. 26:75, Matt. 27:3-4] Pains and Sufferings which are the results of wrong-doing, [Jer. 17:10] <i>e.g.</i>, the results of drunkenness and licentiousness; Legal Penalties which the State, as God's servant to punish crime, inflicts by fines, imprisonment and hanging; [Rom. 13:4] Special Judgments upon individuals [1 Cor. 10:5] in the form of sickness, accidents and reverses, though we must remember that afflictions are not always a judgment, but are often sent upon the godly as a chastening; [Heb. 12:6+] General Judgments upon wicked communities, such as that which God sent upon Sodom and Gomorrah. [Gen. 19:24]</p> <p>Children are often obliged to suffer for the sins of their parents. [Jer. 31:29] If the children also are wicked, their sufferings are a punishment; [Ezek. 18:20, Prov. 3:12, Rom. 8:28] if they are godly, their sufferings are a chastening.</p> <p><i>In the Next World</i> God will punish by Exclusion from Heaven and from His Presence; [Matt. 22:13] and by Eternal Misery in Hell. [Rev. 21:8, Matt. 25:41]</p> <center>II. BLESSING.</center> <p>GOD PROMISES GRACE AND EVERY BLESSING. [Rom. 2:10+]</p> <p>1. <i>To Whom?</i> TO ALL WHO KEEP THESE COMMANDMENTS. It is true, all men are sinners, and no one keeps these commandments perfectly. [Rom. 3:23+] But the godly try earnestly to keep them, [I Cor. 9:27] and are truly sorry for every failure to do so. [Rom. 7:24] To them, therefore, God promises grace and every blessing.</p> <p>2. <i>Why?</i> God will bless them, not because they have earned a reward, but because He is merciful and gracious. [Ps. 103:11+, Joel 2:13] We cannot earn anything from God but punishment. His blessing is bestowed upon us solely as a gift of grace.</p> <p>3. <i>How?</i></p> <p><i>In this World</i> God blesses the godly with: Peace of Heart; [John 14:27] His Favor and Guidance; [Ps. 34:15+] True Success in Life; [Rom. 8:28] and a Blessed Hope of Salvation. [Rev. 2:10+]</p> <p>Children and remote descendants share in the blessing of godly ancestors.</p> <p><i>In the Next World</i> God will grant them: Entrance into Heaven for Christ's Sake; [Matt. 25:34] and Eternal Glory and Blessedness. [John 14:2-3, Rev. 3:21]</p> <p>A WARNING. An impenitent life will bring upon us God's punishment in time and eternity. WE SHOULD THEREFORE DREAD HIS DISPLEASURE, AND NOT ACT CONTRARILY TO THESE COMMANDMENTS.</p> <p>AN ENCOURAGEMENT. A <i>godly life</i> will bring upon us God's blessing in time and eternity. WE SHOULD THEREFORE LOVE AND TRUST IN HIM, CHEERFULLY DO WHAT HE HAS COMMANDED US.</p> <p>THE TEN COMMANDMENTS CONDEMN US; for we have broken them by thought, word, and deed. [John 1:8-10+, Rom 3:23, Eccl 7:20, Jas 2:10+]</p> <p>We are not able to keep them perfectly. [Rom 7:18-19] Consequently we cannot be saved by them. [Gal 3:11] They are meant to show us our sinfulness, [Rom 3:20] to lead us to repentance, and to direct as to Christ for salvation. [Gal 3:24] We can be saved only through Him. [John 14:6+, Acts 4:12+] We are taught concerning Christ, and confess our faith in Him in the Second Part of the Catechism which now follows, namely, The Creed.</p> <p>QUESTIONS.&mdash;1. What does God mean when He says that He is a jealous God? 2. Whom will God punish? 3. Why will He punish? 4. How does He punish? 5. To whom does God promise grace and blessing? 6. Why will He bless them? 7. How will He bless them? 8. What warning is contained in the Conclusion of the Commandments? 9. What encouragement is contained in it? 10. Why can we not be saved by the Ten Commandments? 11. What are the Commandments meant to do? 12. How only can we be saved? 13, Where are we taught concerning Christ?</p> <p>SCRIPTURE VERSES.&mdash;Rom. 1:18. For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness.</p> <p>Ezek. 18:4. The soul that sinneth, it shall die.</p> <p>Rom. 6:23. For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p> <p>Gal. 6:7. Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.</p> <p>Gen. 18:25. Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?</p> <p>Heb. 12:6. Whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth.</p> <p>Rom. 2:10. But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good; to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile.</p> <p>Rom. 3:23. For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.</p> <p>Ps. 103:11. For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy toward them that fear him.</p> <p>Ps. 34:1-5. The eyes of the LORD are upon the righteous, and his ears are open unto their cry.</p> <p>Rev. 2:10. Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.</p> <p>I John 1:8-9. If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</p> <p>Jas. 2:10. For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.</p> <p>John 14:6. Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.</p> <p>Acts 4:12. Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.</p> <p>READING.&mdash;The Fall into Sin and its Punishment, Gen. 3.</p> <p>ILLUSTRATIONS.&mdash;<i>Punishment</i>: Adam and Eve; Cain, Gen. 4:9-15; The Deluge, Gen. 6-8; Sodom and Gomorrah, Gen. 19; The Ten Plagues, Exod. 7-12; Korah, Numb. 16; Saul, I Sam. 15; The Assyrian and Babylonian Captivities, II Kings 17, II Kings 25. <i>Blessing</i>: Abraham, Gen. 12:2; Joseph, Gen. 45:4-8; David, II Sam. 7:16; Cornelius, Acts 4:10.</p>"
