                        <h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>
                        <center>THE BIBLE.</center>
                        <p>THE BIBLE is the inspired and unerring record of what God has
                            revealed to men concerning Himself and the Way of Salvation. [II
                            Tim. 3:16+, Gal. 1:8] Hence, if we ask, "What must I do to be
                            saved?" the answer to our question must be sought in the Bible. It
                            tells us what to believe and what to do in order that we may belong
                            to God's kingdom on earth and in heaven. [Matt. 6:33+, Acts 16:30+,
                            John 5:39+] It is the only rule and standard of Christian faith and
                            life.</p>
                        <p>WHY NEEDED. Even without the Bible, men know that there is a
                            Higher Being. Their own conscience tells them that there is a God
                            who will punish them if they do wrong; [Rom 2:14, 15] and the works
                            of nature proclaim that there is an Almighty Being who created
                            them. [Ps. 19:1+] But the knowledge of God which men gain from
                            their own conscience and from nature is insufficient. Neither
                            nature nor conscience can tell us anything about the Way of
                            Salvation which God has prepared for us in Jesus Christ. It is only
                            from the Bible that we can learn how we shall be saved.</p>
                        <p>ITS INSPIRATION. The Bible is the Word of God. It was written by
                            holy men whom God inspired. [II Pet. 1:21+] It contains knowledge
                            which no man could have discovered by his own power. It foretells
                            events which no uninspired man could have foreseen. It contains
                            teachings so exalted and holy that they could not have originated
                            in the heart of man. It possesses a power such as no merely human
                            book ever did or could possess. [Heb. 4:12]</p>
                        <p>ITS OBJECT is to make us wise unto salvation. [II Tim. 3:15+,
                            Prov 9:10+] It is to be a lamp unto our feet and a light unto our
                            path [Ps. 119:105+] to guide us safely through this world to our
                            heavenly home. It contains all that we need to know and all that we
                            ever shall know in this world concerning God and His will. [Luke:
                            6:31] It is the final and absolute authority in all matters of
                            religion. We should, therefore, pay most earnest heed to its
                            teachings, believe them with all our heart, and apply them in our
                            lives.</p>
                        <p>ITS CONTENTS. It consists of sixty-six "books," written between
                            the years 1500 B.C. and 100 A.D., and contains the History and the
                            Doctrines of the Kingdom of God.</p>
                        <p>OLD AND NEW TESTAMENTS. The Bible consists of two parts: The Old
                            Testament and the New Testament, The Old Testament reaches from
                            Creation to about 400 B.C., and shows how God prepared the world
                            for Christ's kingdom. The New Testament reaches from the birth of
                            Christ to the end of the world, and shows how Christ came and
                            established His kingdom.</p>
                        <p>LAW AND GOSPEL. The Bible contains Law, [Micah 6:8+] telling us
                            what we must do, and Gospel, [John 3:16+] telling us how we are to
                            be saved. The Old Testament contains principally Law, and the New
                            Testament contains principally Gospel. But there are Law and Gospel
                            in both. The Gospel in the Old Testament is prophetical. The Old
                            Testament prepared the way for the New; the New Testament is the
                            fulfilment of the Old. With the New Testament, God's revelation to
                            men was completed; [Heb. 1:1, 2+, Heb. 2:1-3] no further revelation
                            will be given.</p>

                        <p>The <i>historical</i> books of the Old Testament give an account
                            of the creation of the world and of man, of the entrance of sin and
                            death, of God's covenant with Israel to save them, and of the
                            history of Israel as God's chosen people. The <i>poetical</i> books
                            give the teachings of the Old Testament covenant in prayers,
                            proverbs and hymns. The <i>prophetical</i> books contain many
                            instructions, admonitions and prophecies (especially concerning
                            Christ who should come to save men) which God sent to the
                            Israelites through the prophets. The first four prophets are called
                            the Major Prophets; and the last twelve, the Minor Prophets.</p>

                        <p>The <i>historical</i> books of the New Testament give an account
                            of the life of our Lord Jesus Christ and of some of His apostles.
                            The <i>didactical</i> books (the epistles or letters) explain the
                            Gospel of Christ more fully, and show how we are to believe in Him
                            aright and live aright. The <i>prophetical</i> book tells in
                            figurative language what shall take place in the Church of Christ
                            up to the time when there shall be new heavens and a new earth.</p>
                        <p>CANONICAL BOOKS. The sixty-six books enumerated above are
                            inspired, and are called the Canonical Books of the Old and New
                            Testaments. The so-called Apocryphal Books, printed in some
                            editions of the Bible, are not a part of the Bible: they are not
                            inspired.</p>
                        <p>OUR ENGLISH BIBLE. The Old Testament was originally written in
                            Hebrew, and the New Testament in Greek. Our English Bible is a
                            translation from the Hebrew and the Greek. The English Bible which
                            is in ordinary use is called the Authorized Version, or King James'
                            Version. It is a translation made by a body of learned men and
                            published in England in 1611, during the reign of James I. The
                            Revised Version is an improved translation made by a body of
                            learned men in England and America and published in 1881-1885. The
                            Bible in whole or in part has been translated into more than three
                            hundred languages.</p>

                            by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof,
                            for correction, for instruction in righteousness: that the man of
                            God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.</p>

                        <p>II Tim. 3:15. From a child thou hast known the holy scriptures,

                            is in Christ Jesus.</p>

                        <center>THE CATECHISM.</center>
                        <p>The object of catechetical instruction is to fit us for
                            communicant membership in the Church. Those who were baptized in
                            infancy are members of the Church; but they are not admitted to the
                            Lord's Supper, and hence do not become communicant members, until
                            they have been instructed and confirmed.</p>
                        <p>Luther's Small Catechism is our text-book for catechetical
                            instruction. It is not only the best book for this purpose, but is
                            one of the Confessions of our Church, and should become our
                            personal confession of faith, it is called Luther's <i>Small</i>
                            Catechism, because Luther wrote a larger one also.</p>
                        <p>THE AUTHOR of our catechism was Dr. Martin Luther (b. 1483, d.
                            1546), the great Reformer, through whom God effected the
                            Reformation of the Church, in the sixteenth century. He began the
                            Reformation with his Ninety-five Theses against the sale of
                            indulgences, contended against the many errors and abuses that had
                            crept into the Church, and preached and taught the pure truth of
                            the Gospel, until his death. (Ninety-five Theses, 1517; Translation
                            of the Bible into German, 1522-34; Larger and Smaller Catechisms,
                            1529; Augsburg Confession adopted 1530.)</p>
                        <p>THE CATECHISM Contains the principal teachings of the
                            Bible,&mdash;those things which we need to know in order to be
                            saved and to lead a right Christian life. [Acts 16:30, Matt. 6:33]
                            It is not meant to displace the Bible, but to fit us to read and
                            study the Bible with greater profit. [John 5:39]</p>
                        <p>THE FIVE PRINCIPAL PARTS of the catechism are 1. The Ten
                            Commandments. 2. The Creed. 3. The Lord's Prayer. 4. The Sacrament
                            of Holy Baptism. 5. The Sacrament of the Altar[<a href=
                                "#note-1">1</a>]. To these are added Questions on Confession,
                            Morning and Evening Prayers, Thanksgiving before and after Meat,
                            and A Table of Duties.</p>
                        <p><a name="note-1"></a>[Footnote 1: Luther says that three things
                            are necessary for every one who would be saved. Like a sick person,
                            1. He must know what his sickness is. 2. He must know where the
                            medicine is which will cure him. 3. He must desire and seek the
                            medicine, and have it brought to him. Our sickness (sin) is
                            revealed to us by the Ten Commandments. The medicine (God's grace)
                            is made known to us in the Creed. We seek and ask for it in the
                            Lord's Prayer. It is brought to us in the Sacraments.]</p>
