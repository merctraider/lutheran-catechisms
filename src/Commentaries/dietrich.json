And that from a child thou hast known the Holy Scriptures which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.</p> <p>2 Pet. 1:19-21. We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day-star arrive in your hearts: knowing this first, that no prophecy of the Scripture is of any private interpretation. For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.</p> <p>1 Cor, 2:18. Which things also we speak, not in the words which man’s wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual. Luke 10:16; Matt. 10:19, 20.</p> <p>[*] The principal proofs of the divine authority of the Holy Scriptures and of the Christian religion are: <ol> <li>Miracles: Mark 16:15-20; Heb. 2:3, 4; John 10:37-38; 3:2;</li> <li>Prophecy, Is. 41:22-27; 34:16;</li> <li>The witness of the Holy Spirit in the heart, John 7:17; 1 John 5:6; Heb. 4:12-13.</li> </ol> </p>"

                        "answer": "<p> It is manifold: </p> <ol> <li> The Law was implanted in all men at the creation, and is therefore known to all by nature; the Gospel is a mystery which was kept secret since the world began. Rom. 2:14-15; 16:25. </li> <li> The Law precedes, the Gospel follows, in its nature, proclamation, and office. Gal. 3:24. </li> <li> “The Law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.” John 1:17. </li> <li> The Law contains commandments, telling us what we should be, what we should do, and what we should leave undone; the Gospel contains the announcement of the forgiveness of sins, the grace of God, and the benefits of Christ. Eph. 2:14-18. </li> <li> The essence of the Law consists in enjoining and commanding, which requires acts and the performance of works: the essence of the Gospel consists in promising, offering, and bestowing, which requires assent, faith and acceptance. Gal. 3:12; 2 Cor. 5:19-20. </li> <li> The promises of the Law are conditional, being made only on the condition that it be perfectly fulfilled; the promises of the Gospel are gracious promises, which are given to faith. Luke 10:28, Rom. 3:24. </li> <li> The Law teaches good works, but gives no power to perform them; the Gospel is an office of the Holy Ghost, by whom the law is written in our hearts and fulfilled. Gal. 3:21; Jer. 31:33. The Law reveals the disease of sin, accuses, terrifies, proclaims the wrath of God, and condemns those who do not perfectly obey it, but does not avert the divine wrath; the Gospel covers sin, heals the disease, comforts the terror-stricken, and promises grace and eternal life to those that believe. Rom. 4:15; 2 Cor. 3:6. </li> <li> The Law must be preached to the secure, to the unjust, to the ungodly, vicious, and unholy; the Gospel must be brought to the alarmed consciences that thirst for the grace of God. 1 Tim. 1:9; Matt. 11:28. </li> </ol>"

I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.

Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever Thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting Thou art God. </p> <p> Luke 1:37.

Thou knowest my down-sitting and mine up-rising; Thou understandest my thought afar off. Thou compassest my path, and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways. For there is not a word in my tongue, but lo, O Lord, Thou knowest it altogether. Mal. 3:16; Ps. 94:7-11. </p> <p>Jer. 23:23-24. Am I a God at hand, saith the Lord, and not a God afar off? Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him? saith the Lord. Do not I fill heaven and earth? saith the Lord. Ps. 139:7-10; 145:18-19; 91:14-16; 23:4: Ia. 43:1-2.</p> <p>Is. 6:3.
