And that from a child thou hast known the Holy Scriptures which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.</p> <p>2 Pet. 1:19-21. We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day-star arrive in your hearts: knowing this first, that no prophecy of the Scripture is of any private interpretation. For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.</p> <p>1 Cor, 2:18. Which things also we speak, not in the words which man’s wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual. Luke 10:16; Matt. 10:19, 20.</p> <p>[*] The principal proofs of the divine authority of the Holy Scriptures and of the Christian religion are: <ol> <li>Miracles: Mark 16:15-20; Heb. 2:3, 4; John 10:37-38; 3:2;</li> <li>Prophecy, Is. 41:22-27; 34:16;</li> <li>The witness of the Holy Spirit in the heart, John 7:17; 1 John 5:6; Heb. 4:12-13.</li> </ol> </p>"
